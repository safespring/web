You will learn the key differences between `B2` and `L2` flavors, focusing on their storage capabilities. The video highlights how `B2` flavors require an external volume for boot operations, whereas `L2` flavors include built-in storage suitable for operating systems but with a caveat on data persistence and security. 

This guide is essential for users looking to make informed decisions about instance configurations and understanding the implications of each flavor for their specific needs in cloud environments.
