This tutorial offers an in-depth look at setting up and managing security groups within OpenStack, crucial for controlling access to instances across various network configurations. 
{{< /ingress >}}

Beginning with an overview of security groups' role in defining what can interact within the OpenStack environment, the video guides viewers through creating and applying security groups named "frontend" and "backend" to manage web and database servers respectively. 

The session demonstrates how to configure security rules that enable HTTPS and MySQL traffic, utilizing the capability to reference other security groups instead of specific IP addresses for scalability and ease of management. 

This approach not only simplifies adding new instances to existing groups but also ensures that all related instances maintain consistent communication permissions. 

By the end of this tutorial, users will understand how to leverage security groups to create a secure, scalable, and easily manageable network infrastructure within their OpenStack platform.
