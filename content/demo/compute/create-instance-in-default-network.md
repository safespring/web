This tutorial demonstrates the practical use of jump hosts to securely access instances that are not directly reachable from external networks. 

Starting with a setup that includes instances in both public and default networks, the video shows the step-by-step process of transferring necessary SSH keys to a public jump host, enabling secure shell access to a backend instance located in a less accessible network. 

The guide emphasizes the role of security groups and network settings in ensuring secure and controlled connectivity across different network layers. By following this guide, users will gain a clear understanding of managing secure connections and network configurations in a multi-instance OpenStack setup. 

This session is crucial for administrators and developers who need to maintain robust security protocols while ensuring operational flexibility in their cloud environments.
