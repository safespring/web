Join us in this detailed demonstration where we guide you through the process of creating SSH keys for secure access to the OpenStack environment. 
{{< /ingress >}}

Starting with the basics, this video covers the generation of an RSA SSH key using the `ssh-keygen` command, including optional passphrase settings for enhanced security. 

We then proceed to illustrate how to handle the public key by uploading it to the OpenStack platform and managing key pairs within the system. 

This tutorial is perfect for users of the Safespring OpenStack service looking to ensure secure and efficient access to their cloud instances.
