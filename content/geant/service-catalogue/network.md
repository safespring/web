{{< ingress >}}
Mandatory and optional network services when using the IaaS platforms.
{{< /ingress >}}

The network design of the Compute platform is based on L3 (IP) and hardware-based routing. Virtual routers or L2 overlay networks are not used. This ensures maximum network performance and operational simplicity at all scales. Security is based on sets of L3 IP address access control lists. If a customer requires overlay networks, they are free to deploy them â€“ at less overhead and at higher performance than in competing provider solutions.

Safespring has peering with the National Research and Education Networks (NREN) with redundant connections to SUNET in Sweden and redundant connections to SIKT in Norway.

These NREN:s are connected with Nordunet which gives a fast connection for customers connected to NREN:s in the whole of Europe.

Safespring supports both {{< inline "SAML2" >}} and {{< inline "OIDC" >}} for federated identity handling and authorization to the platform.

- Public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses directly assigned to network interface.
- Private addresses for site-internal communication.
- Ingress / Egress traffic controlled by API driven ACL.
- Managed SLB (based on BGP and haproxy).
- Bring your own IP prefixes (for large customers).
- Reverse DNS Configuration (for large customers, own prefixes).

## Public IP addresses
Safespring provides public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to the services. By default, each instance receives one of each.

## Ingress and egress traffic
Safespring measures ingress and egress traffic for each customer instance at the network border of each datacenter. Safespring does not bill for ingress or egress traffic. Safespring is directly connected to SUNET, SIKT and NORDUNET networks.

## Load balancing
Safespring offers functionality to give the customer means to set up load balancers in the platform. The solution is based on iBGP with anycast routing functionality that enables a secure and stable load balancing solution.

## Reverse DNS Configuration
Safespring offers the option to configure reverse DNS names (PTR records) for public IP addresses, tailored to customer needs. This service is particularly relevant for use cases such as hosting SMTP servers or other services where reverse DNS is critical. Requests are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and we will provide an estimated cost based on the specific requirements.

## Bring your own IP prefix(es)
Customers can allocate their own IPv4 prefixes to the platform for their own use in the platform (minimum size /24). Safespring configures these prefixes in the platform and announce them to its peers using BGP.
