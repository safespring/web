Cloud compute services contains the following categories (OpenStack flavors):

- Compute with local NVMe storage (‘**L2**’)
- Compute (‘**B2**’)

Base disks are default root disk sizes unless a volume with a different size is specified when deploying an image. Ephemeral disks are extra local storage devices accessible to a virtual machine on a specific hypervisor, for flavour types where applicable.

## Compute with local NVMe storage

The compute with local NVMe disk profile has both 1:2 and 1:4 vCPU:RAM ratio profiles. It comes with choices of local ephemeral NVMe storage.  The term ephemeral means that the storage has the life time of the instance and is only stored with one copy on the local disk on the compute node where the instance is running. This makes the instances well suited for automated setup, where a loss of a separate instance is easily handled with provisioning or cluster member for databases or Kubernetes worker nodes.

### Prerequisites
None.

### Compute without local storage

The basic compute profile comes with both 1:2 and 1:4 vCPU:RAM ratio profiles. It does not have ephemeral storage and must be created with a backing volume from the central storage service.  

#### Prerequisites
None.

#### Configuration

| Product Code        | vCPU | Memory |
|---------------------|------|--------|
| FLAVOR-b2. c1 r2    | 1    | 2 GiB  |
| FLAVOR-b2. c1 r4    | 1    | 4 GiB  |

| FLAVOR- b2. c2 r8   | 2    | 8 GiB  |
| FLAVOR- b2. c4 r8   | 4    | 8 GiB  |
| FLAVOR- b2. c4 r16  | 4    | 16 GiB |
| FLAVOR- b2. c8 r16  | 8    | 16 GiB |
| FLAVOR- b2. c8 r32  | 8    | 32 GiB |
| FLAVOR- b2. c16 r32 | 16   | 32 GiB |
| FLAVOR- b2. c16 r64 | 16   | 64 GiB |

### Central block storage

Central block storage is provided by Ceph HDD and SSD clusters.

#### Prerequisites
Server instance to attach volume to, including as a root disk volume.
