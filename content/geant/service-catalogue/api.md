{{< ingress >}}
All Safespring’s services have APIs to enable the user to use the services in a more automated fashion.
{{< /ingress >}}

## Compute API

Safespring Compute is built upon OpenStack which comes with an extensible API. The services that Safespring provides API access for are:
1.	[Nova Compute](https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/compute/). This API supports creation, deletion and modification of instances (virtual machines) in the platform.
2.	[Keystone Identity](https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/identity/v3/). The API handles all identity handling and RBAC in the platform. This is the API to which a user login in order to get an authentication token which then can be used to subsequent calls to other APIs in the platform.
3.	[Glance Image handling](https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/image/v2/). This API handles images and snapshots, from which an instance can be created. The used can also use this API to upload custom images to the platform. 
4.	[Neutron Network](https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/network/v2/). This API handles networking. Since Safespring is using the networking engine Calico, this API is restricted since not all operations can be done when using this networking engine. 
5.	[Cinder Block Storage](https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/block-storage/v3/). This API gives access to block storage operation such as creating and attaching volumes to instances.

## Storage API

Safespring Storage support the S3 API. The S3 API is the de-facto standard for interacting with object storage services. The service is provided with the Ceph storage project, and the operations supported by the implementation can be viewed here: https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/radosgw/s3/.

## Backup API

Safespring Backup uses the product Cloutility from Aawau. The API specification can be found here: https://portal-api.backup.sto2.safedc.net/v1/help.
