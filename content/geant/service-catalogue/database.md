## Database as a Service
Safespring provides MariaDB, MySQL, Redis, PostgreSQL and MongoDB as services on top of the Compute platform.

### Updates and upgrades
- The DBaaS is kept up to date with security patches and new versions. This includes the database application.

### Backups and disaster recovery
- A full backup of the database is taken every day. The time when the backup should be performed as well as retention time can be set in the service. 
- Backups stored in Safespringâ€™s S3 Storage service in another datacenter.
