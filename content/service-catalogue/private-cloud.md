{{< ingress >}}
Complete offer for Private Cloud deployment, including hardware, operations and software maintenance.
{{< /ingress >}}

IaaS base offer includes Control Plane and Compute Service with local instance storage only.
Options include Elastic Block Storage (Ceph cluster) and accelerated compute nodes (typically GPU).
STaaS base offer includes Control Plane and storage nodes of either HDD or NVME type.

Storage interfaces include RADOS, S3 via Rados Gateway, Rados Block Device or iSCSI/NFS via storage proxy.

## Private Cloud – IaaS
The IaaS base configuration is for deployment in a dedicated rack space, preferably with room to grow. The ToR switches are based on 32x100 Gbps and scale to 24 compute or storage nodes due to 4 interfaces being reserved for control plane, 2 for interswitch-links, 2 for uplinks. 

If multi-rack deployment additional ports required for cross-connect. Compute Node configuration (CPU, RAM, local NVME) per customer specification.

### Prerequisites
None.

| Product Code              | Component                                     | Rack Units |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------|
| PRIVATECLOUD-compute.base | IaaS Compute Base configuration               | 12         |
| PRIVATECLOUD-compute.add  | IaaS Compute Additional nodes (4 per chassis) | 2          |


## Private Cloud – IaaS Volumes Option
The IaaS Volumes option adds NVME, HDD or both elastic storage to the Private IaaS deployment. It reuses the switches and control plane of the Private IaaS deployment. The ToR switches are based on 32x100 Gbps and scale to 24 compute or storage nodes due to four (4) interfaces being reserved for control plane, two (2) for interswitch-links, two (2) for uplinks. 

If multi-rack deployment additional ports required for cross-connect. Storage interface is Rados Block Device (RBD) to compute hypervisor. HDD Storage Node fits 12x3.5”, maximum size per drive depends on market availability and uses Optane drive for DB. NVME Storage Node fits 10x2.5” NVME, drive write endurance and size depends on market availability and customer preference.

### Prerequisites
IaaS Base configuration.
