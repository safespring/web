## Introduction to IaaS for managers

### Before course starts 
To ensure that participants gain maximum benefits from the training, detailed questionnaires will be sent to all course participants to establish exactly where their training needs lie. The completed forms will be analyzed by the course trainer. We also provide online studies to prepare you for the course.
As a result, we ensure deliverance at the appropriate level and issues participants regard as relevant are addressed. The comprehensive course materials will enable them to digest the subject matter in their own time. After the course A second Questionnaire will be sent out for a Post Training Effectiveness Assessment. The purpose of this questionnaire would be to measure and assess the learning outcomes with the participants a month after the training to gauge their level of understanding in implementing what they have learnt. Thus, identifying further areas for improvement.
