{{< ingress >}}
On this page, you'll find information about our Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud compute services, including detailed configurations and categories of compute services available.
{{< /ingress >}}

Cloud compute services contains the following categories (OpenStack flavors):

1. [Basic compute](#1-basic-compute)
1. [Memory Optimized compute](#2-memory-optimized-compute)
1. [Basic compute with local NVMe disk](#3-basic-compute-with-local-nvme-disk)
1. [Memory Optimized compute with GPU and local NVMe disk](#5-memory-optimized-compute-with-gpu-and-local-nvme-disk)
1. [Bare Metal Compute](#6-bare-metal-compute)

Base disks are default root disk sizes unless a volume with a different size is specified when deploying an image. Ephemeral disks are extra local storage devices accessible to a virtual machine on a specific hypervisor, for flavor types where applicable.

{{% note "Larger flavors" %}}
If you haven't found the ideal flavor for your service, don't worry! We offer a range of larger flavors that are not currently available on the platform. To learn more, please reach out to Safespring at [hello@safespring.com](mailto:hello@safespring.com).

## 1. Basic Compute
The basic compute profile offers a 1:2 vCPU to RAM ratio, which means that for every virtual CPU allocated, there are two gigabytes of RAM available. This profile has HyperThreading disabled on the hypervisors and does not include ephemeral storage. Additionally, the CPU oversubscription ratio is limited to a maximum of 1:4, ensuring that there is no more than four times the number of virtual CPUs than physical CPUs available on the host.

### 1.1. Prerequisites
None.

### 1.2. Configurations

## 2. Memory Optimized Compute
The memory optimized compute profile provides a 1:4 vCPU to RAM ratio, which means that for every virtual CPU allocated, there are four gigabytes of RAM available. This profile also has HyperThreading disabled on the hypervisors and does not include ephemeral storage. In addition, the CPU oversubscription ratio is limited to a maximum of 1:6, ensuring that there are no more than six times the number of virtual CPUs than physical CPUs available on the host.

## 3. Basic Compute with local NVMe disk
The basic compute with local NVMe disk profile offers a 1:2 vCPU to RAM ratio, meaning that for every virtual CPU allocated, there are two gigabytes of RAM available. This profile includes local ephemeral NVMe storage options. The CPU oversubscription ratio is set to a maximum of 1:3, meaning that there can be up to three virtual CPUs for every physical CPU available on the host.

### 3.1. Prerequisites
