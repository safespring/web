{{< ingress >}}
The IaaS platform contains a storage service based on the Ceph object storage cluster, providing object-storage as a service using an S3-API compatible interface.
{{< /ingress >}}

## S3-API-compatible Storage Service
Safespring provides Storage-as-a-Service using object-based storage, provided by the Ceph Rados Gateway. Safespring provides the S3 API-compatible as of the Ceph versions depicted below. Exact API support level can be read on the relevant documentation page, see references below. 

### Prerequisites
None.

### Ceph Versions

| Product Code | Type       | Site | Version         |
|--------------|------------|------|-----------------|
| S3-standard  | S3-storage | OSL2 | v17 (Quincy)    |
| S3-standard  | S3-storage | STO1 | v15 (Octopus)   |
| S3-standard  | S3-storage | STO2 | v15 (Octopus)   |


## Direct RADOS-integration of application
Safespring supports the direct integration of applications onto the RADOS layer, when performed and deployed by Safespring in a controlled manner. 

It is not possible for users to directly access this storage layer. The integration will be done by Safespring at professional service-based pricing, and a subsequent maintenance charge will apply. The exact pricing depends on the scope of the project and is therefore evaluated on a case by case basis.

### Prerequisites
None.
