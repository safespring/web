## Managed Kubernetes
The managed Compliant Kubernetes platform includes the following features and capabilities:

{{% accordion title="Security and compliance" %}}

- Private container registry
- Intrusion detection systems (IDS) for alerting in case of breaches
- Automated image vulnerability scanning
- Integration with authentication providers such as Active Directory, SAML, and OIDC, e.g. Google authentication
- Audit logging in the Kubernetes API server to track activities in the cluster
- Role based access control (RBAC)
- Compliance policy enforcement
- Secret management
- Automated certificate handling
- Network segregation (network zones and isolation east-west traffic)
- Network isolation and restrictive firewalls, allowing only permitted network traffic into the platform. Inbound traffic to the cluster is securely handled using the Nginx ingress controller

### Managed Kubernetes – overview
Safespring’s managed Kubernetes service is built on Compliant Kubernetes (CK8s). Compliant Kubernetes is a proven, stable and secure Kubernetes platform built on open source cloud-native components. In addition to what is included in a standard “vanilla” managed Kubernetes service, Compliant Kubernetes brings the following value:

- Worry-free container operations with platform managed "twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week" in ISO certified, European data centers.
- Pre-configured best practice security tooling to reduce compliance burden for frameworks such as ISO-27001, GDPR and PCI-DSS.
- Makes it easier to stay secure and compliant over time by enforcing policies across the whole software development lifecycle without restricting developers.
- Lessens the audit burden by providing detailed and easy to access audit trails.
- Makes applications easier to manage from an operations, compliance and security perspective by providing an enterprise UI that acts as a single point of entry to all relevant tools, policies, and configuration.
- Decreases the operational burden by managing all additional components required for a secure and compliant Kubernetes environment such as observability (logging, monitoring, auditing), authentication, secret management, intrusion detection, vulnerability scanning and a private container registry.
