## Base IaaS Support
Safespring has one unified support model for all its services. Safespring is operating an expert level support organization that is part of the technical DevOps team. Requests and incidents are handled by personnel with deep technical knowledge of the services provided. Written support requests are handled in English for all customers.

In order to maintain a structured and well documented process, each request to support is handled by a ticketing system. 

For handling and resolution of incidents, e-mail is used for communications. E-mails sent to the support email address are automatically added to the ticket history for the incident.

Safespring uses RT which is an open source issue tracking and workflow platform developed and supported by Best Practical Solutions. Documentation about how to build an integration with RT can be found here. https://docs.bestpractical.com/rt/4.4.4/index.html 

The support that is offered includes an extensive support available 24/7/365 for customers using e-mail or phone.

### Online resources

Safespring keeps an updated status information for all services at https://status.safespring.com. In addition, customers can subscribe to status updates via email, sms, or integrate into their own solution using webhooks.

Examples of configurations are also provided in the online documentation.

Safespring maintain videos with updated How Toâ€™s with guidelines and tutorials for all services. The channel is updated with new material based on user requests or when a new product is launched.

## Standard support
Access to backchannel chat room with support and engineering.

Users can request access to a community chat room where users of Safespring services can meet each other as well as Safespring support and engineering.

## Premium support
The premium support includes a dedicated technical account manager that is available to develop the delivered service. The technical account manager is also a resource for planning the roll-out of new services based on years of experience working with infrastructure for very demanding customers. Safespring's cloud architects are also available for design of new projects and migration resources into Safesprings resources.

The technical account manager can be dedicated to a customer organization or shared depending on the resource need. Meetings, technical service review, and design activities are performed in online web meetings.
