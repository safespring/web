## STACKn (Machine Learning)
STACKn is a highly flexible, open-source, cloud-native open toolkit for full-stack data science projects, and the entire machine learning lifecycle.

The application covers all stages from data ingestion and transformation, feature extraction, model definition, training, and evaluation, to deployment, inference and monitoring with infrastructure automation on top of Kubernetes. It is built to take machine learning to production at any scale.

Key benefits:

- Continuous Analytics
- End-to-end workflow orchestration
- Simple deployment
- Open source (Apache2)
- Intuitive UI

STACKn offers a resourceful and agile approach to develop, operate and deploy machine learning models and enables individuals and organisations to quickly get started with machine learning and AI practices through Scaleout’s open source end to end solution.

### Machine Learning Framework Agnostic 
Supports most machine learning frameworks out of the box and with open APIs support extension for additional frameworks.

### End to End Workflow Orchestration 
Automate your workflows to handle tasks such as grid searches or active learning pipelines. Support for automating pipelines from data ingestion to model deployment and monitoring.

### Cloud Infrastructure Agnostic 
Setup and run anywhere Kubernetes can run. No lock-in, full flexibility to run on cloud, hybrid, on-prem or bare-metal setups.

### Simple Deployment 
It runs anywhere you can run Kubernetes – hosted, on-prem, in the cloud or on your laptop.

### Open Source 
Our solution is open source and is building on top of the best available open source tools and components, with no lock-in effects or hidden agendas.

### Turnkey Ready 
Deploy the stack anywhere you can run Kubernetes. Get started on your laptop or workstation with Minikube or minik8s or run full-scale production systems on Kubernetes or OpenShift.

### Tools and Libraries 
STACKn is building on top of the best available open source tools and components. It deals with the complexity of integrating open source toolchains for machine learning and DevOps into a full stack data science solution. STACKn will continue to evolve with the open source DevOps and ML community, and through active development by Scaleout and partners.

Example of open source software that is used: Docker, Kubernetes, K3s, Kn, Jupyterhub, Grafana, Keycloack, Minio, Prometheus, OpenFaaS, Istio, Juju, Argo, Rancher, Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE), Gitea, Elasticsearch.

## Backup Ninja
Backup Ninja is a database backup service that automates database backup creation, scheduling, notification and much more with simple step-by-step configuration wizards to help users create secure database backups that can be stored on-premises, or on the public or private cloud.

Rather than using specialized tools and products for every database technology, users can manage all open-source database backups for both physical and virtual servers from a single convenient dashboard with Backup Ninja. 

Backup Ninja provides the user with a single location to manage backups for multiple databases with different database vendors and backup methods. Users with a variety of databases can benefit from the unified approach Backup Ninja provides to protect and manage the entire database environment. It has built-in integration with multiple cloud storage providers to store backups. The user just needs to provide the cloud credentials and it will be available as one of the backup destinations when scheduling a backup. 

### Prerequisites
- Safespring IaaS
- The Backup Ninja agent service must be installed with super-user privilege (root or sudo sudo user). When setting up database access for Backup Ninja agent, the provided commands must be executed by a database user that has the ability to create user, role and grant privileges e.g, root user.
- Supported Operating System:
  - Backup Ninja has been tested on the following operating systems (x86_64 architecture only):
    + CentOS 6/7
    + Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6/7
    + Ubuntu Server 12.04/14.04/16.04/18.04 LTS
