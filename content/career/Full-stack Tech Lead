{{< ingress >}}
Safespring is hiring a Full‑stack Tech Lead to help build our Self-service API and a new customer portal that make our cloud easy to understand, easy to use, and ready to scale. This is a hands‑on role where you work across backend and frontend, and help a small team get a lot done.​
{{< /ingress >}}

## Why this role matters

We’re building the cloud Europe deserves - open, trustworthy, and competitive.

Built heavily on open‑source technologies, our platform can scale from a single VM in public cloud to multiple racks in a customer’s private cloud. 

Being a small company means we have to be smart with our time and money: we aim to build things once, build them well, and make them work for many customers.

The Self-service API and portal are central to that. The platform is built on an event driven architecture (some details can be found in the blog post here). They should make it simple for customers to see and manage their resources,  robust enough to scale, and boring enough that our support and infra team doesn’t get 3 a.m. pages.

## What you’ll work on

- Design and evolve the Golang based Self-service API so that customers and internal teams have a clear, consistent way to work with compute, storage, backup, and container services.​ Our platform is event-driven, build on-top of NATS.
- Lead the development of a (new) self‑service portal: from frontend architecture with Next.js and React to how it talks to the backend and external systems. 
- Make practical choices that balance “nice engineering” with what we can actually build and maintain as a small team, while still preparing for more users and more data.
- Use and contribute to open‑source tools and libraries wherever it makes sense, and avoid reinventing things that the community already solved well.​
- Improve developer experience: testing, CI/CD, observability, and documentation, so each engineer can ship safely and quickly.
- Mentor and support teammates through design discussions, pairing, and thoughtful code reviews.
- You will spend most of your time building and improving the product, not just coordinating work.

## Who we think might enjoy this?

Working at a small company means living with ambiguity. Priorities shift, context is incomplete, and there is no neatly scoped ticket every morning handed in. 

If you like finding the real problem, owning it, and shipping solutions that last - you’ll thrive here. 

If you prefer very narrow responsibilities or large, highly specialized teams, this may not be the right opportunity. 

## What’s in it for you?

- A real chance to shape user-facing services that makes European tech autonomous! 
- Flexible, remote-friendly working conditions, with a possibility to work from the Stockholm office
- Tech gear of your choice
- Training opportunities to keep you growing
- The stability of a collective bargaining agreement (or comparable benefits outside of Sweden)
- Teammates who’ll push you forward by questioning your solutions, contributing new perspectives, and exploring the tech rabbit holes that lead to better answers.

## Your team and ways of working 

Your team works on what customers touch first - the APIs and portal. You’ll collaborate closely with infrastructure engineers and customer‑facing colleagues who translate real‑world insights from customers directly into what we build.

We work in two‑week sprints with demos and retros that actually improve how we work.

We are remote-friendly team, however we value time spent together. We meet for company offsites in May, and travel for tech conferences together (e.g. KubeCon or OpenInfra). 

Some of the projects in our 2026 roadmap include:

- Introducing an external API and golang SDK for our customers
- Prototype a terraform provider for the external API
- Introduce upgrade schedules for on-demand Kubernetes into our self-service portal
