## Who are you?

{{< ingress >}}
You’ve spent time designing and running networks in datacenters. You know your way around BGP, and you’ve configured more routers than you can count.
{{< /ingress >}}

Who are you? 

Maybe you’ve automated network deployments with infrastructure-as-code, or you’ve spent late nights debugging weird routing issues that shouldn’t have happened in the first place.

Now, you want to do something that actually matters. Work on infrastructure that’s open-source, sovereign and built with sustainability in mind. 

At Safespring, we’re giving European organizations an alternative to the hyperscalers - open-source-powered, sustainable, and European-based cloud infrastructure that puts security, transparency, and digital sovereignty first. We are looking for a Network Engineer who can help us build, improve, and scale it.

## What will you do?

- Design and deploy -  architect and implement datacenter network solutions, both physical and virtual.
- Manage layer 3 platforms -  oversee platforms utilizing SONiC, Juniper, and Calico.
- Automate deployments: use infrastructure-as-code to streamline network setups across our datacenters.
- Enhance networking products - develop and improve services like ElasticIP, our BGP-based load balancer.
- Expand IPv6 and security - increase IPv6 coverage and implement security measures such as RPKI.
- Collaborate across teams -work closely with Kubernetes, OpenStack, and storage teams to deploy and troubleshoot network solutions.
- Share your networking expertise with the rest of the team   

## We believe you: 

- Got solid experience with Linux, and BGP in datacenter environments. 
- Take ownership and aren't afraid to initiate solutions.
- Make infrastructure choices and select appropriate devices. 
- Contribute to open source - you believe in the power of shared, transparent technology.

## Your team

We are a remote-friendly team at Safespring with colleagues scattered around Europe. You will join the cross-collaborative IaaS team that currently consists of 8 colleagues, and is led by Jiri.

## What’s in it for you?

- A real chance to shape user-facing services that make a difference
- Work in a team that values collaboration 
- Flexible, remote-friendly working conditions
- Training opportunities to keep you growing
- The stability of a collective bargaining agreement  

Oh, and the satisfaction of building tech that’s open-source, sustainable, and locally driven.
