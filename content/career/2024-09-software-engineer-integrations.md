Are you a Golang-driven software engineer who is looking for a new challenge? Join our product team and help us redefine the cloud experience for our users.
{{< /ingress >}}

Safespring is growing and we are now looking for a talented **Software Engineer** specialised in **Integrations** who will help us advance the user experience for our cloud users by refining business logic and maximizing self-service features. 
 
You'll be building APIs, leveraging event-based messaging, and maintaining supporting technologies like Terraform, Pulumi, or other kinds of commonly used API abstraction layers that power our services.
 
We are an open-source-driven company which means  we not only consume open-source software, but also contribute back to open source projects, in a good community spirit. We believe that giving back to upstream projects is key to our growth, sustainability, and influence in shaping their future.

## Your Team 

We are a remote-friendly team at Safespring with colleagues scattered around Europe. You will join the cross-collaborative Product Team that currently consists of 4 colleagues, and is led by Jarle, our CPO. You will have the unique opportunity to shape the future of our user facing self service capabilities and the underlying business logic, by utilizing the most vital and suitable open source software to build it. This role is ideal for someone who thrives in a collaborative environment and wants to contribute to building and refining sustainable cloud technologies. 

## What will you do?

- {{< inline "Build and Operate:" >}} You will build and maintain continuously delivered and tested production grade APIs and event based architectures using tools like Golang, frameworks for API documentation and integration with message queueing systems like NATS.
- {{< inline "Continuous Improvement:" >}} Take the initiative in enhancing the performance and capabilities of our services. Your contributions will directly impact the customer experience, ensuring our solutions meet and exceed their expectations. 
- {{< inline "Strategic Alignment:" >}} Work closely with the tech leads to align your efforts with the strategic goals of our team. Your insights and suggestions will be crucial in driving the progress. 
- {{< inline "Collaborative Development:" >}} Engage in discussions, pair programming, and actively seek and provide feedback within the team to advance collective knowledge and capabilities.
- {{< inline "Documentation and Transparency:" >}} Maintain a clear record of your work and decisions in our work management system, linking code changes to work descriptions to ensure transparency, traceability and knowledge sharing. 

## Who are you?

### We believe you have: 

- Expert level on development of integration technologies and microservices like REST-APIs, message queues and database technologies using Golang
- Very good coding skills in Go and extensive knowledge about existing libraries/frameworks, and their mapping to use cases. 

### It’s beneficial if you have: 

- Knowledge about Openstack API using Gophercloud framework. 
- Experience with Kubernetes, operators and custom resource definitions (CRDs). 

Our core services are Openstack and Kubernetes (Openshift/OKD at the moment)-based. Most of the continuously delivered business logic you develop and operate will run on internal kubernetes platform(s) that in turn runs on Openstack. We aim for an operator driven architecture, thus, familiarity with construction and operation of Kubernetes operators will be necessary. 

## What’s in it for you?
- At Safespring, we believe in fostering a culture of continuous learning and growth. We offer a range of training and development opportunities to help you advance your career and stay up-to-date on the latest industry trends.
- The chance to be a key player in building a cutting-edge CI/CD experience.
- Opportunity to contribute to local and sustainable cloud services.
- A supportive and agile work environment in a rapidly growing company.
- Flexible & remote/hybrid work.
- Collective bargaining agreement.
