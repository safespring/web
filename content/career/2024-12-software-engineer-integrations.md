## Are you our next colleague?

{{< ingress >}}
You’ve built REST APIs. You know your way around event-based messaging. You’ve written Golang code that gets used. Now, you’re looking for your next challenge.
{{< /ingress >}}

We are hiring a Software Engineer (Integrations) to refine our cloud platform’s user experience. You’ll build the APIs and business logic that let users help themselves – and make our services more powerful in the process.

### Why us?
We’re not just another cloud provider. Safespring delivers open-source-powered, sustainable, and European-based cloud infrastructure that puts security, transparency, and digital sovereignty first - with no lock-in effect! We’re small enough that your work will make a visible impact, and smart enough to know that open-source isn’t just about taking – it’s about giving back.

### What will you do?
- Build and Operate: Write production-grade APIs and event-driven architectures using Golang and tools like NATS
- Improve our services to give users a smoother, faster, and more self-sufficient experience.
- Collaborate with tech leads, pair program with colleagues, and refine your craft every day.
- Stay Transparent: Keep your work traceable and well-documented. It’s about sharing knowledge.

### What you've got?
- Solid Golang skills -  you know the libraries, frameworks, and tools.
- Experience building integrations with REST APIs, message queues, and databases.
- You know how to build microservices and make them work well together.

It's beneficial if you also know your way around Openstack, Kubernetes (CRDs, operators), or the Gophercloud framework. 

### What's in it for you?
- A real chance to shape user-facing services that make a difference
- Flexible, remote-friendly working conditions
- Work with talented colleagues that value collaboration 
- Training opportunities to keep you growing
- The stability of a collective bargaining agreement.

Oh, and the satisfaction of building tech that’s open-source, sustainable, and locally driven.

### Who will you work with? 
You will join a small, cross-functional R&D department led by Jan Ivar. We’re a remote-friendly, open-minded team spread across Europe.
You’ll also work closely with engineers who believe the best code isn’t just written – it’s shared and improved together.
