You will directly impact our mission to deliver local and sustainable cloud services. This is your chance to contribute to a fast-growing company at the forefront of cloud technology, fostering a culture of transparency, innovation, and collaboration. 

### Your future team 

We are a remote-friendly team at Safespring with colleagues scattered around Europe. You will lead the newly built Container Platform Team that will consist of 4 engineers including you. 

Currently, the platform is being built with the Community Distribution of Kubernetes that powers Openshift (OKD). The platform team will build, maintain and operate the container service from scratch on top of Safespring’s production IaaS.

The product is built and operated by consuming Safespring’s IaaS products, OpenStack and CEPH.

### What will you do?

The platform tech lead is responsible for taking the customer experience of our container platform offering to the next level.  You will provide mentorship, context and priorities to team members to unblock them and create progress.

- **Lead and Mentor:** Support a team of engineers in building and operating the Safespring’s container platform. Drive the strategic vision and operational excellence of our Kubernetes-based systems.
- **Collaborative Leadership:** Promote a culture of transparency and collaboration, facilitating open discussions and knowledge sharing within the team. Ensure documentation and traceability of work through our management system (JIRA), linking code changes to work descriptions.
- **Innovate and Improve:** Champion continuous improvement initiatives that enhance platform performance and user satisfaction. Your leadership will directly impact the evolution of our services to meet and exceed customer expectations.
- **Strategic Oversight:** Provide guidance aligned with the broader strategic goals of our container platform. Your decisions will be pivotal in advancing the platform's development.

### Who are you? 

You are a visionary leader with a robust open-source software engineering mindset. 

We think you might also have:

- Sound experience with Kubernetes and lifecycle management of containers.
- Expertise in CI/CD tools (e.g., ArgoCD, Flux) and Kubernetes deployment tools like Helm or Kustomize.
- A strong background in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and tools such as Terraform, Ansible, Cfengine, Puppet.
- Skills in managing IaaS solely through API utilization (e.g., using Terraform, Ansible, Shell/CLI), and familiarity with OpenStack APIs.
- Solid knowledge in network engineering (IPv4/6, routing, bridging, VPN-overlays like wireguard) and security within container management.
- Programming skills, preferably in Python, Golang, and shell scripting.

### What’s in it for you? 

- Continuous Learning and Growth: Access to numerous training and development opportunities to further your career and keep you at the forefront of industry innovations.
- Influence and Impact: Play a key role in shaping a state-of-the-art CI/CD experience from the ground up.
- Contribution to Sustainability: Help deliver local and sustainable cloud services in an agile and supportive work environment.
