{{< /ingress >}}

As a **Platform Engineer** at Safespring, you will have the unique opportunity to shape the future of our Kubernetes-based container platform. This role is ideal for someone who thrives in a collaborative environment and wants to contribute to building and refining sustainable cloud technologies.  

### Your Team
We are a remote-friendly team at Safespring with colleagues scattered around Europe. You will join the newly built Container Platform Team that will consist of 4 engineers. 

Currently, the platform is being built with the Community Distribution of Kubernetes that powers Openshift (OKD). The platform team will build, maintain and operate the container service from scratch on top of Safespring’s production IaaS.

The product is built and operated by consuming Safespring’s IaaS products, OpenStack and CEPH. 

### What will you do?

- **Build and Operate:** Collaborate with a dedicated team to build and maintain the Safespring container platform from the ground up. You'll work with the Community Distribution of Kubernetes (OKD) and may engage with other Kubernetes variants as needed.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Take the initiative in enhancing the performance and capabilities of our platform. Your contributions will directly impact the customer experience, ensuring our solutions meet and exceed their expectations. 
- **Strategic Alignment:** Work closely with the tech lead to align your efforts with the strategic goals of our container platform. Your insights and suggestions will be crucial in driving the platform's progress. 
- **Collaborative Development:** Engage in discussions, pair programming, and actively seek and provide feedback within the team to advance collective knowledge and capabilities.
- **Documentation and Transparency:** Maintain a clear record of your work and decisions in our work management system (JIRA), linking code changes to work descriptions to ensure transparency, traceability and knowledge sharing.

### Who are you?

You have an open-source software engineering mindset. You are keen on enabling users of Kubernetes to efficiently manage their containerized application lifecycle with the lowest possible effort. 

We think you most likely also got:

- Experience in Kubernetes and container lifecycle management
- Proficiency in CI/CD tools (e.g. Flux, ArgoCD) and Kubernetes deployment tools like Helm or Kustomize 
- Familiarity with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and configuration management tools like Terraform, Ansible, Cfengine, Puppet
- Ability to manage IaaS by means of utilizing API  only (via tools like Terraform, Ansible and/or  Shell/CLI), and preferably experience with the OpenStack APIs.
- Strong foundation in network engineering (IPv4/6, routing, bridging, VPN-overlays like wireguard.) and security in container management.
- Programming skills, preferably in Python, Golang, and some Shell scripting.


### What in it for you? 

- At Safespring, we believe in fostering a culture of continuous learning and growth. We offer a range of training and development opportunities to help you advance your career and stay up-to-date on the latest industry trends.
- The chance to be a key player in building a cutting-edge CI/CD experience.
- Opportunity to contribute to local and sustainable cloud services.
- A supportive and agile work environment in a rapidly growing company.
- Flexible & remote/hybrid work
- Collective bargaining agreement
