Our mission is to empower customers to innovate swiftly, reduce time to market, remove technical constraints, increase efficiency, and maintain data sovereignty.

We are currently expanding our cloud-based compute and storage services, delivered from professional data centers in Norway and Sweden. To keep up with the increasing demand for our services, we are seeking experienced Infrastructure Engineers who are experts in OpenStack, Ceph, and infrastructure as code to join our dynamic technical teams.
