## Introduction
This White Paper describes how to configure Safespring Storage as a “Disk Library” in Commvault. The only prerequisite is that you have a storage account at Safespring and a running Commvault solution. With that, you will be able to be up and running with a disaster backup solution in minutes.

### Customer benefits of moving data to Safespring
Offsite backups are primarily is used in data backup and disaster recovery measures. The core objective behind storing and maintaining data at a backup facility is to:

- Secure data from malicious attacks
- Keep a backup copy of data in case the primary site is damaged or destroyed

Cloud backup, online backup, or managed backup are examples of offsite backup solutions that enable an individual or organization to store data at facilities that are geographically and logically external.

S3 is becoming the de-facto standard interface for object storage with increasing support in different kinds of backup software. By combining the backup solution you already have with S3-storage at Safespring you will get an off-site backup of your data, integrated with your current backup solution at a low price.
