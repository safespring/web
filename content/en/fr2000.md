At Safespring, we always strive to deliver the highest quality in our services while prioritizing the environment and occupational health and safety.
{{< /ingress >}}

FR2000 is a Swedish management system standard that encompasses quality, environment, and occupational health and safety. The standard is based on the principles of the well-known ISO standards 9001 (quality), 14001 (environment), and 45001 (occupational health and safety). By adhering to these principles, we ensure that we have a structured, controlled, and systematic approach to our work.

## Why FR2000?

There are two main reasons why we have chosen to certify ourselves according to FR2000:

1. **Customer requirements and procurements**: Many of our customers require a demonstrated certificate in connection with procurements, especially those covered by the Swedish Public Procurement Act (LOU). FR2000 is widely recognized in Sweden and is equivalent to the aforementioned ISO standards, allowing us to meet these requirements effectively.
2. **Structure and continuous improvement**: Following the standard's requirements helps us create a clear structure and promotes continuous improvement within our organization. By implementing systematic and effective solutions, we can constantly improve our processes and services.

### Benefits of FR2000 Certification

- **Quality assurance**: We have a structured approach to ensuring high quality in all our services.
- **Environmental awareness**: We actively work on environmental issues and strive to reduce our environmental impact.
- **Occupational health and safety**: We prioritize the health and safety of our employees by following strict occupational health guidelines.

By being certified according to FR2000, we at Safespring can offer our customers extra assurance and confidence that we are continuously working to improve our services and operations. We are dedicated to maintaining these high standards and look forward to continuing our journey towards sustainability and quality in all aspects.

## Certification Process

The FR2000 certification process is carried out by accredited certification bodies that follow the same auditing procedures as for the ISO standards. This ensures that our certification meets the highest possible standards and that our customers can trust that we comply with the requirements.
