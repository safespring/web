Download our price calculator and build your current environment to see what you save by moving to Safespring. The price includes high security, both physical, logical, and legal. You also get 24/7 support and access to our self-service portal where you can manage your instances as needed.

## No Traffic Cost

Safespring does not charge any traffic cost for data sent to or from our services. Traffic cost, or Egress cost as it is also called, is a common lock-in mechanism. Safespring is built on open standards and it is part of our philosophy.
