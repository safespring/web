On 6 May 2025, the EuroStack Industry Group, now over 200 strong, sent its second open letter to President von der Leyen, EVP Virkkunen and EVP Séjourné. Safespring is proud to stand with our peers in calling for the full deployment of the EuroStack by 2030.

Europe’s digital ecosystem is at a crossroads: continue as a “digital colony” dependent on US and Chinese providers, or build our own, sovereign infrastructure. The data are clear, over 80 % of large European enterprises’ cloud and software spending still flows to US giants, leaking jobs and value out of our economy. Even the major US vendors themselves now hedge against geopolitical risk with hollow promises to sue their own governments rather than secure our digital sovereignty.

The Commission has acknowledged that digital strategic autonomy is imperative. Since our first letter on 14 March, we’ve seen:
- Germany’s new coalition agreement explicitly endorse “EuroStack” as the blueprint for sovereign cloud and software.  
- The French government publicly reaffirm its commitment to break foreign dependencies.  
- The Dutch parliament pass motions to halt public migrations to US clouds and prioritize home-grown solutions.  

Meanwhile, the EU’s 2025–27 Digital Decade Work Programme has earmarked €1.3 billion for digital projects – funds that should be deployed to build the foundational layers of our stack: chips, cloud, connectivity, software and AI platforms.

What Europe lacks is not talent or quality, we have world-class infrastructure providers, an open-source ecosystem and thousands of innovative software SMEs. Our perennial challenge is fragmentation: inconsistent standards, siloed procurement and no coherent industrial policy to scale solutions across borders.

The second EuroStack letter reiterates three pillars for immediate action:
1. **Buy European** – public procurement mandates to favor European providers, reflecting total cost of ownership, resilience and data sovereignty.  
2. **Sell European** – harmonised technical and legal standards so our solutions can scale across all 27 Member States.  
3. **Fund European** – strategic investment in core components to close gaps and power future innovation.

The attached white paper, *[Deploying EuroStack: What Needs to Happen Now](https://euro-stack.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EuroStack-White-Paper-Final-1.pdf)*, lays out concrete, rapidly implementable proposals, from enforceable openness requirements to harmonised certification schemes and procurement blueprints. These are the same industrial policy levers that built today’s tech giants elsewhere; it’s time Europe uses them in our own interest.

Safespring proudly joins over 200 European tech companies in urging the Commission, Council and Parliament to work hand-in-hand with industry. Let’s deploy the EuroStack by 2030 and secure a resilient, sovereign digital future for Europe’s public sector, businesses and citizens.
