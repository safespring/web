## Win Procurements Together with Us

{{< ingress >}}
With your service on Safespring's platform, you get a stronger offer in procurements.
{{< /ingress >}}

Cloud services are growing by over 20 percent per year and currently account for an average of eleven percent of the total IT budget. Cloud services in procurements are also expected to increase, as well as the requirements for correct handling of personal data and sensitive information.

With Safespring as a subcontractor, you can bid on more procurements with more specific requirements. We are happy to help you in cases where these issues are called for and are important. We have long experience and a strong network in procurement. We also provide you with a dedicated contact person and support channel.

### No Questionable Subcontractors

Our platform removes the complex process for partners to review and evaluate multiple subcontractors and, in turn, their subcontractors' suppliers. Safespring handles data correctly, and that's where the chain of subcontractors ends.

Safespring's cloud service is not affected by rulings such as the invalidation of Privacy Shield (Schrems II), CLOUD Act, or FISA 702 as American cloud providers are.

Our platform has never had to compromise with Swedish or European legislation. The correct handling of personal data in the cloud has been a debate for a long time, and no solution has been presented. Instead, many individuals or companies have chosen to interpret the issue differently, and the only thing we know is that the legal situation is only becoming more complex and tightened.

As partners of Safespring, you can guarantee your customers the correct handling of personal data and other sensitive information without compromise. With data centers in Sweden and as a completely Swedish company, our platform guarantees security, both technically and legally, that data stays in Sweden and is handled correctly.
