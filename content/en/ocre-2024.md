{{< ingress >}}
Safespring has been delivering reliable cloud services to the research and education sector since our launch. Empowering research and education with compute resources, container platforms, scalable storage, and flexible backup solutions is at the heart of what we do.
{{</ ingress >}}


## Why use OCRE 2024?

There are many ways that a research and education organisation can do public procurement of Safespring’s cloud services, it could be through the internal procurement organization that does a full procurement process or making a call off with mini-competition from a governmental framework but the easiest and fastest is OCRE 2024. The reason for this is threefold:

1. The framework already has customer friendly [terms and conditions](https://about.geant.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Volume3-GEANT-Terms-and-Conditions-for-IT-Contracts-2025final-1.pdf).
2. There’s no need for a mini-competition – just contract Safespring directly
3. The prices are already discounted but can be further negotiated.

### About OCRE
The OCRE 2024 framework is an EU-compliant cloud procurement framework, administered by GÉANT, the collaboration of European National Research and Education Networks.

It is the third iteration of GÉANT’s flagship cloud frameworks that since 2016 have fostered digital transformation across Europe by bridging the supply of innovative commercial cloud services with the demand and requirements of Research and Education institutions. Procured via a public pan-European tender and with support of the GN5-1 project, the OCRE 2024 Framework is set to be in place across 39 Countries for a period of five years, from February 2025 until 2030. 

The framework enables participating organisations to procure cloud services, in a compliant, easy and cost-effective way.
