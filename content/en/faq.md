{{% question question="How is physical access to the data centers managed?" %}}
Physical access to our data centers is regulated by strict security procedures. All visits must be pre-registered with the data hall administration, and the visitor must present valid ID. Upon arrival at the data center, the visitor receives a temporary key card with a pin code that only works for the specific hall and the specific cage where our equipment is located.

To ensure the highest level of security, Safespring has the highest security classification according to MSB's Tier 3. The data center is built according to standards specifically designed for availability requirements according to Tier-3, MSB's highest physical classification for data centers. This includes security measures such as six different steps (barbed wire, physical guards, various security levels before reaching the servers), 24/7 CCTV surveillance, security guards, access barriers such as airlocks with fingerprint readers, and contactless key cards with biometric readers.

{{% question question="Redundancy for power supply, cooling, and network?" %}}
Yes. The data halls have backup power systems that make the data center independent of the power grid. Fire detection with air analysis, server halls with IT-friendly extinguishing systems, and fire alarms directly connected to the alarm center. Powered by 100% green electricity.

The room temperature must not be allowed to vary outside the temperature limits of +18 °C to +23 °C. The room must be equipped with ventilation and cooling devices (of the precision cooling type). Underfloor cooling should be used. The ventilation and/or climate system should produce positive pressure. Temperature alarms, connected to the company's regular alarm monitoring, must be present.

A device for regulating the room's humidity should be used. Risks of liquid leakage from the cooling system must be considered. Supply air and air passing through climate equipment must be filtered. These filters must be changed regularly. Supply air ducts must be equipped with smoke detectors connected to fire dampers or automatic fan stops. Air exchange should be dimensioned according to the work environment requirements for the number of people intended to be continuously present in the room. Emergency cooling (additional cooling medium) must be available to ensure continuous operation. The cooling capacity of the room's cooling system should be investigated but should be dimensioned with at least 2 kilowatts per square meter of area.
