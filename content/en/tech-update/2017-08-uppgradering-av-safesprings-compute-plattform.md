In line with Safespring’s goal to keep pace with OpenStack’s official releases (with a three-month delay to ensure stability), the work to upgrade to the latest release, Ocata, is now well underway.

The upgrade is expected to improve integration with the Ceph storage platform, which will make a number of disk-dependent operations faster.

Details about the upgrade can be found at [https://status.safespring.com](https://status.safespring.com).
