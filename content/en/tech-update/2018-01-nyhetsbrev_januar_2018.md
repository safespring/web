Our backup services are available in three different versions, and the guide helps you decide when each is the best fit from a cost perspective.

Additionally, as of this fall, Safespring is a partner with Microsoft, enabling us to offer images with the Windows Server operating system on the Compute platform.

## Safespring Backup

We offer three versions of Backup:

- Large
- Small
- On-Demand

Together with Sikt, we have created a guide that provides guidance on which service fits best depending on your needs.

## Safespring offers the Microsoft Windows operating system on the Compute platform

To meet users’ needs for running Microsoft applications, Safespring has launched Windows as a supported operating system on the Compute platform.
Many customers have requested this, and we have therefore entered into an agreement with Microsoft as a “Services Provider.” We can therefore offer the following operating systems:

- Windows Server 2008 R2
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2016

The licensing costs for running Windows on the platform are added to the regular resource costs.

Customers who have a Software Assurance agreement with Microsoft can also install their Microsoft applications on Safespring’s platform. Software Assurance gives Microsoft customers the flexibility to choose which applications to run locally or with other providers without the need for additional licenses.

As part of entering into the agreement, the customer must sign an EULA for Microsoft products with Safespring.
