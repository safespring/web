{{< ingress >}}
Here you’ll have the freedom to shape the way cloud networking and automation is done, right from the data centre and backbone up to APIs and user-facing services. Your ideas will get built because curiosity and practical problem-solving matter more than long CVs.
{{< /ingress >}}

Enjoy Nordic work-life balance and the stability of a collective bargaining agreement, giving you peace of mind around employment conditions[*](#info). You’ll work alongside sharp colleagues who will challenge and inspire you, while contributing to advancing a true European cloud.

You can work fully remote, from the Stockholm office, or anywhere in Europe, with a home-office fund and equipment of your choice to support you.

You will join Europe-wide team that’s big on trust and low on micromanagement.

## What you’ll do

- Automate hybrid networks, creating tools for deploying, monitoring and scaling using Ansible, Terraform and Python (or Go, if that’s your preference)
- Build and improve real-world services like ElasticIP, BGP-based load balancers, RPKI and making IPv6 rollout easier
- Troubleshoot where app, OS and packet meet, solving issues like flaky routes, odd DHCP requests or user features that haven’t been built yet
- You’ll deepen your expertise in networking, automation and cloud-native environments while working on complex, high-impact systems  

## What you’ll need

- Good hands-on experience with Linux, Kubernetes, infrastructure-as-code and cloud-native setups
- Practical knowledge of networking, having debugged BGP, automated router configs or managed IPv6 deployments
- A knack for making smart choices around hardware, vendor and open-source solutions  

## About us

## FAQ

{{% accordion title="I live outside of EU, can I still apply?" %}}
We’d love to welcome talent from everywhere, but right now our work on sovereign cloud services means we can only hire people based in the EU and with a valid work permit there. If you’re not currently in the EU, we hope you’ll keep an eye on our future openings — we’re growing and things can change.

No problem! We work with a trusted Employer of Record (EoR) in your country. This lets us hire you where you are, give you a local contract, and make sure you get the same care, benefits, and legal protections as everyone on the team.
