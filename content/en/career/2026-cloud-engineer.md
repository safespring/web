## Why this role matters?

We’re building the cloud Europe deserves - open, trustworthy, and competitive. The market and opportunity for EU-made tech has never been better. 

Built heavily on open‑source technologies, our platform can scale from a single VM in public cloud to multiple racks in a customer’s private cloud. 

Being a small company means we have to be smart with our time and money: we aim to build things once, build them well, and make them work for many customers.

## Who are you?

You like building things that actually run, not just in theory. Whether it’s improving Ceph clusters, tuning hypervisors, or automating tricky setups, you want your work to matter and your ideas to take shape.

You’ll join a small but experienced team where curiosity and autonomy are valued over bureaucracy.

You can work fully remotely, from our Stockholm office, or anywhere in EU. We’ll sort you out with the gear you need, plus all the stability that comes from a collective bargaining agreement (or equivalent outside Sweden).

## What you’ll do

- Design, run, and improve Ceph‑based storage systems - keeping performance, reliability, and data safety top‑of‑mind.
- Work with hypervisors, automation tools, and orchestration to deliver resilient compute and storage platforms.
- Contribute to our Kubernetes‑based stack, integrating and scaling vm as well as storage workloads across clusters.
- Automate deployments, upgrades, and monitoring - prefer Terraform, Ansible, or your own clever approach? Great.
- Work in a highly collaborative team, where experimentation and iteration are part of the job.

## What you’ll need

- Solid hands‑on experience with Linux and cloud‑native environments.
- Real‑world experience running Ceph, managing hypervisors, and working with automation frameworks.
- Familiarity with Kubernetes, and comfort operating in complex, often ambiguous environments.
- A pragmatic mindset for balancing performance, simplicity, and maintainability.
- Above all, we value drive and curiosity: someone who picks things up, figures them out, and keeps moving - even when the path isn’t fully mapped.

## Bonus points if you have

- Experience with BGP or Layer 3 networking.
- Worked with the Rook operator for Ceph automation.
- Written or maintained CI/CD pipelines.


## Your Team and ways of working

You’ll join us at IaaS Team (Infrastructure as a Service) consisting of 5 talented engineers, lead by Anders Johansson. 

We work in two‑week sprints with demos and retros that actually improve how we work.
Your future team is remote-friendly, however we value time spent together. We will meet for company offsites in May, and travel for tech conferences together (e.g. KubeCon or OpenInfra).

### Projects we are currently working on include:

- Developing innovative OpenStack upgrade methods, enabling us to skip multiple versions and catch up quickly with tech debt 
- Migrating internal control planes from libvirt to Kubernetes with KubeVirt 
- Consolidating internal tooling between the PaaS team and the IaaS team.

## Reality check

Working at a small company means living with ambiguity. Priorities shift, context is incomplete, and there is no neatly scoped ticket every morning handed in. 

If you like finding the real problem, owning it, and shipping solutions that last - you’ll thrive here. 

If you prefer very narrow responsibilities or large, highly specialized teams, this may not be the right opportunity. 

## Interested?

We care more about how you solve problems than how polished your CV looks. Click Apply, drop us what you have, and we’ll take it from there.

For this role you need to be based in EU.
