## Build trust, Grow business, Help Nordic companies break free from hyperscaler dependency!

{{< ingress >}}
Safespring isn’t your typical cloud provider. We’re not chasing hyperscale. We’re not locking anyone in. We’re building something different - a  European alternative for organizations who care about security, privacy, and independence.
{{< /ingress >}}


And behind that mission? Real people who care about their craft, their customers, and each other.

For years, we’ve been the trusted cloud partner for universities, research centres and healthcare providers across Sweden and Norway. But now? 

We’re ready for our next chapter. We're entering the Enterprise market and expanding our business in the SaaS market. On purpose. On our terms.

This is where you come in! 

We’re looking for a relationship driven Senior Account Manager who can help us break new ground. Someone who’s as passionate about relationships as they are about results. Someone who understands that real sales isn’t just about “closing” - it’s about building trust - and playing the long-term game. Sounds like you?

### What will you do?
- You’ll grow and develop existing customer relationships -  helping them get more value from Safespring.
- You’ll open doors with SaaS companies and enterprise customers - building trust long before a contract lands on the table.
- And after it lands on the table, you’ll still be there, because that’s when the real work starts.

### What you've got?
- You are tech-savvy enough to hold your own conversations about things like Kubernetes and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). You can break down complex ideas, understanding what the customer really needs, and turning that into smart solution suggestions. 
- You like solving real problems for real people - not just selling for the sake of it.
- You understand the Enterprise and SaaS world - their hopes, fears, buying cycles and budget battles.
- You understand and enjoy technical sales - but you're not afraid to say "I don't know, but I’ll find out."
- You have a deep understanding of the current market, and curiosity about technologies in general.

### Your Team
We are a small diverse team of 25 colleagues who believe in transparency, open source technology, sustainability and data sovereignty. You will join Sales Team that currently consists of Fredric, our founder, Daniel, our business and strategy developer, and Petter, our commercial manager.

### What’s unique in our tech set-up?
We are proud to say we are at the European forefront of providing highly-available services such as compute, storage, backup, and container platform, built with open-source. We use Linux, CEPH for storage and OpenStack for orchestration.

### What’s in it for you?

- A key role in shaping Safespring’s next phase of growth
- Impact - we are small enough that your daily work will make a visible impact on whole company, and big enough that you feel supported in your role
- Room to do things your way 
- Smart, kind, technical colleagues who care deeply about what they do
- Customers who want partners
- A flexible and hybrid work environment 
- Stability of a collective bargaining agreement
- Market salary & commission on sales 

This is a hybrid role with our office in Solna, Stockholm. Our Sales Team meets in person at least twice a week.
