Because we are a Swedish company that provides these services in Sweden, you can comply with eSam's recommendations.

## White paper

Now that cloud services subject to US law can likely no longer be used in public procurement, we at Safespring have released a white paper on the new legal situation.

This white paper outlines the conditions following the ruling and provides recommendations for organizations within the EU; it is divided into four chapters.

- The Schrems II ruling (Part I),
- the market structure for cloud services and the interplay between technical requirements and the law (Part II),
- the role of various Swedish stakeholders in further developing this market structure, and in particular the need to coordinate efforts at the state level (Part III)
- and a brief description of the way forward (Part IV).
