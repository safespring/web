## Swedish Cloud Services

{{< ingress >}}
Digital sovereignty through Swedish cloud services built with open standards and open source.
{{</ ingress >}}

Our cloud services make it possible to meet the requirements for control and data security while benefiting from the cost-effectiveness and flexibility that modern cloud services provide.

Being a Swedish company that produces the services in Sweden makes it easy for you in the long term to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as well as the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act.

## Safespring

Discover cloud services built on openness, sustainability, and security. With our commitment to open standards and green data centers, we offer a secure and efficient cloud platform. Read on to see what makes Safespring unique.

### Open Source

All Safespring's cloud services are built with open source components because these are industry standard and are the most technically advanced software available.

### Open Standards

All Safespring's cloud services use open standards because, unlike several of our competitors, we do not believe in vendor lock-in. Instead, we believe that we are so good and cost-effective that customers want to stay by choice.

### Sustainability

All Safespring's cloud services are delivered from modern and sustainable data centers in Sweden. For example, we use only green electricity, have high energy efficiency, and utilize residual heat.

### Legal Security

Because Safespring is a Swedish employee-owned company with data centers in Sweden, you do not have to worry about future rulings from the EU Court affecting, for example, your personal data processing.

### Collective Agreement

All employees at Safespring are covered by collective agreements and we are members of Almega. Feel free to ask your current provider if all their employees are covered by collective agreements.

### Political Security

Because Safespring is a Swedish employee-owned company with data centers in Sweden, political decisions in, for example, the USA cannot affect the provision of our cloud services.
