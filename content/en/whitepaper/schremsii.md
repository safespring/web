## Information guide on the EU Court of Justice’s invalidation of Privacy Shield

{{< ingress >}}
Now that cloud services subject to U.S. law likely cannot be used in procurements, we at Safespring have published an information guide on the new legal situation.
{{< /ingress >}}

This notice addresses the situation after the judgment and recommendations for organizations within the EU; it is divided into three chapters. <span id="down"></span>

- Schrems II ruling (Part I),
- the market structure for cloud services and the interplay between technical requirements and law (Part II);
- and a brief description of the way forward (Part III).
