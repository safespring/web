{{< ingress >}}
At Safespring, we are proud to be a company that works hard to reduce our environmental impact. An important step we have taken is to ensure that our data centers use 100% renewable energy.
{{< /ingress >}}

By choosing renewable energy, we avoid carbon emissions that would otherwise be harmful to the environment.

To confirm our sustainability performance, we have chosen to have our services certified by "The Green Web Foundation". This organization works to strengthen the internet as a green place and certifies companies that use renewable energy for their website and digital services. Having our services certified by The Green Web Foundation is a step in the right direction to becoming a greener organization.

![This website is hosted Green - checked by thegreenwebfoundation.org](https://app.greenweb.org/api/v3/greencheckimage/www.safespring.com?nocache=true)

But it is not only our use of renewable energy that makes us a sustainable business. All our data centers are designed to have a PUE below 1.2. PUE stands for "Power Usage Effectiveness" and is an important factor in measuring the energy efficiency of a data center. A PUE below 1.2 means that we use a minimal amount of energy to run our data centers, which is an important part of reducing our environmental impact.

At Safespring, we will continue to work to reduce our environmental impact and continue to be a sustainable business. We are proud of our environmental work and are determined to do our part to protect our planet.

## Safespring's Sustainability Work

{{< ingress >}}
Safespring's goal is to contribute to a cleaner world by delivering high-quality infrastructure services to our customers in the Nordics, so that they can produce their services without their own investment in hardware. This will mean lower carbon emissions.
{{< /ingress >}}

The companies that have the most to gain from implementing these types of solutions are many. Therefore, the potential gains are significant. Safespring uses these solutions internally for the same reason.

We achieve a much greater effect externally by selling environmentally friendly technology such as large-scale production of IT services, which means that the utilization rate is significantly higher than comparable dedicated solutions.

As a medium-sized company working with products and services that do not pollute, Safespring does not leave a large CO2 footprint. But it is our philosophy that it is the many small actions that will make the big difference. Because of this, we are aware of how we can contribute in our daily work. The steps we have taken so far are listed below:

- Safespring employees do not travel unless necessary. Voice and video conferencing solutions are standard.
- Employees take their computers home every day and do not leave them powered overnight.
- Safespring's offices should have active environmental work and be within walking distance of public transport, preferably trains.
- Safespring employees should fly with airlines with modern aircraft, which gives a smaller CO2 footprint.
- Safespring participates in various national recycling arrangements such as the return of used electronic equipment and source sorting.
- Waste is recycled as far as possible (local authorities and property owners prepare and organize).

### ISO 14001 Framework for Our Environmental Policy

Safespring uses ISO 14001:2004 as a framework for our environmental work. The standard serves as a framework to help organizations develop their own environmental management systems.

With regard to ISO 14001, Safespring focuses primarily on reduced carbon footprint and recycling. What our business can potentially burden the environment with the most is primarily energy consumption in our data centers, business travel, and IT products to produce our services. We have therefore chosen to use climate-smart data centers with 100% green and renewable electricity. We are also frugal with travel and primarily use tele- and video conferencing, and we participate in recycling arrangements. Safespring employees are spread across Sweden and Norway and conduct video meetings within the organization and with customers to reduce travel and climate impact.

### Environmental Considerations in Purchasing and Procurement

To the extent possible, we use modern energy-efficient solutions to produce our services. The hardware used in our data centers is continuously modernized to be as energy-efficient as possible. When purchasing and procuring, the environmental aspect is always included in the decision-making process to ensure that we achieve our set environmental goals.

### Resource Utilization and Reuse

The hardware that forms the basis of our platform is reused in our internal development when it is no longer suitable for production, as far as possible, before it is recycled in a climate-smart and sustainable way.

Safespring keeps purchases of computers and service phones down to avoid unnecessary consumption and impact on the climate. Repairs and servicing of hardware should be the first step before the item is recycled and possibly replaced.

## Safespring's Offices and Work Environment

{{< ingress >}}
Safespring's headquarters is operated by Castellum and is located close to Stockholm's subway, commuter train, light rail, and 14 different buses within a few minutes' walk.
{{< /ingress >}}

This means that Stockholm's public transport is the first choice for our employees. Castellum has active environmental work and a sustainable way of working.

Many employees cycle to work, which Safespring encourages by ensuring that bicycle parking and changing rooms are available adjacent to the office.

The health of our employees is important to us, and therefore we offer wellness allowances and encourage an active lifestyle. We have a collaboration with Actic to provide our employees with better tools to stay healthy.

Our employees also have the opportunity to work from home, which increases well-being and the ability to manage everyday life more smoothly.

### Staff Training in Environment and Sustainability

The entire Safespring staff meets four times a year to, among other things, review the company's environmental goals and sustainability work.

Staff also actively participate in focus groups and work with the aim of reducing Safespring's CO2 footprint. Issues addressed include how we can work climate-smart in the office environment, travel sustainably for business, and how we can make our platform more efficient.

## The Sustainability of Our Data Centers

<div class="ingress"><p>All Safespring data centers actively work for more sustainable production. 100 percent renewable energy sources power the data centers.</p></div>

One of our data centers has, since 2015, used Fortum Värme's cooling service for data centers.

The cooling service with heat recovery provides the data center with chilled water, and the data center returns the water at a temperature of at least 24 degrees Celsius. The offer includes monitoring, alarms, and service agreements.

The chilled water cooling and heat recovery are provided by Fortum Värme's plant and delivered via the district cooling network. At the data center, a heat exchanger, mixer, and circulation pump are all that is required to reliably cool the data center. The recovered excess heat from the data center goes into large heat pumps at Fortum Värme's facility and is then sent to the district heating network and out to thousands of homes in the Stockholm area.

All our data centers are powered by 100 percent renewable energy sources and drive initiatives for more sustainable production. Safespring co-location in Oslo works to increase hydropower-driven data centers.

### Safespring Stockholm North

The data center recycles the heat generated from production back to the district heating network, which annually heats thousands of apartments in the Stockholm area. The data center is secured and built as a building within a building. Surveillance with CCTV takes place around the clock every day of the week, and security guards patrol the area. There are several access barriers, including airlocks, contactless key cards, and biometric readers.

Safespring Stockholm North uses only 100 percent green energy and has done so since 2012. Since 2015, the data center has had a unique project together with Stockholm Exergi (formerly Fortum Värme) where they recycle heat from the data center to the district heating network. Annually, this heats thousands of apartments in Stockholm.

The development of more energy-efficient data centers is ongoing, which means that continuous changes are made to the design of data centers, including, among other things: Raising the floor in the data centers from 60 cm to 120 centimeters to reduce the need for cooling.

### Safespring Stockholm South

Safespring Stockholm South meets high requirements for operational reliability and availability.
The data center is currently 2,800 sqm, of which 1,100 sqm are data zones. The data center is powered 100 percent by electricity from renewable energy sources, and work is constantly being done to find new ways to increase energy efficiency.

The data center manager can extract access system and camera material if we wish. Safespring's premises are locked so that they cannot be affected or manipulated by outsiders.

The building standard is designed for Tier-3 availability requirements according to Safespring's security policy. There is also a backup power system that makes the data center independent of the power grid. The data center has fire detection with air analysis. Server rooms with IT-friendly extinguishing systems and fire alarms directly connected to the fire station and burglar alarms directly connected to the alarm center, as well as 24/7 monitoring by our own NOC.

- UPS with N+1 or 2N
- Cooling system with N+1 or 2N
- Design for 1.2-1.3 in energy efficiency (PUE)
- Prepared for energy recovery
