Great that you are interested in learning more about what a partnership with us entails. We are constantly looking for new and exciting ways to deliver our services!

Our services are, as mentioned, versatile and our solutions provide a very good foundation for many different types of industries and applications. However, we also know that we cannot reach all customers on our own, which is why we collaborate!

## Here are several different types of partnerships:

### Reseller

You are probably an IT partner or system integrator and have customers who buy most things from you, but need to complement your offering with good infrastructure and cloud services. You can then use our services to complement your offering. You sell our standard services, but you have direct contact with your customers, both regarding sales and invoicing of the services.

### White Label

You want to sell our services, but you want the services to have your name and your profile. You may also want to take greater ownership of administering your customers on the platform. Then White Label might be something for you.

### Application Partner

You yourself offer an application or service to your customers, which works well to run in a cloud service. You want a partner who supports you in your delivery and a platform that lives up to your high standards. Either you resell our services, or you package them together with yours and sell it as a service (SaaS).

We also encounter customers who have needs for expertise and solutions that we do not have ourselves. Then we may need to complement our offering through partners:

### Competence Partner

You are experts in an area where cloud and infrastructure services can be an effective building block. You may be interested in being part of our projects, or having in-depth information from us to be able to recommend our services to your customers.

## Become a partner

Do you recognize yourself in the above or have your own ideas for a partnership model? Contact us, as we are convinced that collaboration is a winning strategy!
