## Safespring's Involvement in the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)

As a crucial partner in the EOSC initiative, Safespring provides key infrastructure services under the **Exchange Infrastructure Services** and **Exchange Application Services** categories. Collaborating with the Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center (PSNC), Safespring offers managed compute, and container platform that is consumed directly by researchers, but also as the "engine" for enterpise file sync and share, jupyter notebooks and file transfer services provided by other partners to PSNC. These services are essential for supporting European research efforts, enabling efficient data processing, sharing, and collaboration among institutions.
