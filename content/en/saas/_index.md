Safespring understands that your customers have high demands for the correct handling of sensitive data and that your customers’ trust in you is important.
{{< /ingress >}}

Safespring is a Swedish cloud service provider with Swedish data centers, focusing on ensuring that our customers’ data is handled only by our customers and always remains in Sweden.

In almost all SaaS, personal data is involved, which means that both you and your subcontractors need to meet the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If you use Safespring for your IaaS/PaaS, your customers’ analysis regarding personal data processing becomes trivial compared to using American cloud services, which, among other things, means you can focus on selling the value of your service instead.

## Legal Aspects

Both you and we at Safespring operate in a trust-based industry where it is increasingly critical to review our dependencies and partners. Our customers will place ever higher demands on political and legal security in addition to traditional IT security and operational reliability.

Safespring is a Swedish public cloud platform that greatly simplifies your compliance with Swedish and European legislation. With a focus on open standards and digital sovereignty, Safespring offers services such as virtual servers, large-scale storage, container platforms, and backup as a service. With data centers in Sweden and Norway, Safespring is a proven and secure platform for SaaS companies, authorities, data-driven companies, and the academic sector.

In almost all SaaS, personal data is involved, which means that both you and your subcontractors need to meet the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). When, for example, American subcontractors are used, it is much more complicated to meet the requirements, more analysis is required, and customers will ask more questions. If you instead use Safespring, the entire analysis becomes trivial in comparison, which, among other things, means you can focus on selling the value of your service instead of discussing third-country transfers, Schrems, etc.

If your SaaS contains confidential information, whether it is information covered by the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act, attorney-client privilege, or commercial confidentiality, you must be able to guarantee that confidentiality is maintained. American cloud service providers can never guarantee confidentiality, as is clear from their terms and conditions. Safespring has no such terms and will not disclose our customers’ information except when required by a Swedish court.

## Technology

Safespring provides a reliable and flexible infrastructure that makes it easier for you as a SaaS provider to deliver your services with high performance and availability. The network stack is built with Calico, giving you secure, scalable, and high-performance communication between your services while ensuring stability and operational reliability. The OpenStack platform gives you access to a wide range of instance types, making it easy to adjust capacity to your needs and optimize costs.

The storage is tailored to meet your varying requirements, with both local NVMe storage for extremely fast data access and Ceph-based central storage. The Ceph solution comes in two variants: one SSD-based for high performance requirements and one cost-effective storage based on traditional disks for large amounts of data such as logs and backups. Ceph is also a self-healing and distributed solution that ensures high availability and redundancy, giving you security and stability in your data management flow.

Safespring is an ideal platform for those working with container-based applications and Kubernetes environments. The stable infrastructure and modern network solution make it easy for you to deploy and manage container-based services smoothly. We are also actively developing our own Kubernetes-based platform to further simplify management and scaling, all so that you can focus on developing your services without unnecessary technical complexity.

By choosing Safespring, you get a secure, flexible, and high-performance infrastructure optimized for your needs as a SaaS provider. Our platform enables you to focus on your core business instead of technical limitations, while ensuring that your services can grow and adapt to future requirements.
