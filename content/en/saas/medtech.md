## Background

{{< ingress >}}
Many MedTech companies choose to move their patient data back to Europe for increased security and control.
{{< /ingress >}}

This trend is driven by requirements for high security and data protection for patient data. GDPR and other local regulations require careful handling of personal data. If you choose a non-EU-based solution, you risk violating these laws.

Swedish cloud platforms like Safespring store all data in Sweden and are subject to Swedish legislation, giving you both the capacity and flexibility to meet your patients’ and customers’ expectations.
