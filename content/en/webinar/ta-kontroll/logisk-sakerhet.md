## Explore logical security

{{< ingress >}}
This section provides an in-depth understanding of how companies can use logical security to strengthen their overall security posture, which is crucial for protecting sensitive information in an increasingly uncertain digital environment.
{{< /ingress >}}

In this section, Amelia Andersdotter, Head of Risk and Compliance at Safespring, and Gabriel Paues, cloud architect, discuss the concept of logical security and its importance for data-driven companies. They explore how logical security measures can complement physical security measures to provide comprehensive protection.

Amelia and Gabriel highlight various aspects of logical security, including encryption, data storage, and redundant systems that protect data even in the event of physical failures. They also discuss modern techniques such as containerization and confidential computing, which protect data both in use and at rest, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
