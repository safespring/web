In this episode, Gabriel Paues, cloud architect at Safespring, and Amelia Andersdotter, head of risk and compliance at Safespring, discuss the complex dynamics between political and legal security. They explore how political decisions can rapidly alter the legal frameworks that companies must navigate, especially in an EU context.

The conversation begins with a discussion of the relationship between political and legal uncertainties. Gabriel and Amelia explain how these factors are intertwined yet differ in stability and predictability. Amelia offers examples from the EU where political decisions can change quickly, creating challenges for companies that must adapt to new regulations.
