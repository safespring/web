## Explore flexible security

{{< ingress >}}
This section highlights the importance of building systems with built-in, application-level security mechanisms to manage and minimize risks in an increasingly flexible and dynamic digital environment.
{{< /ingress >}}

In this section, Amelia Andersdotter, Head of Risk and Compliance at Safespring, together with Gabriel Paues, Cloud Architect at Safespring, discuss how flexible security can be applied to strengthen the protection of applications. They explore the role of flexibility in creating robust and secure environments where applications can adapt quickly without compromising security.

They begin by explaining how modern software development techniques, such as containerization, allow applications to run independently of the underlying hardware and infrastructure. Gabriel emphasizes how containers can reduce dependence on specific operating systems and hardware resources, enabling updates and maintenance to be carried out more efficiently and with less disruption.
