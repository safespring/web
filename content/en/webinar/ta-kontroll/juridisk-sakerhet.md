## Understanding legal security

{{< ingress >}}
This section provides insight into how companies can navigate and manage legal security effectively, which is crucial for long-term success and compliance.
{{< /ingress >}}

In this section, two experts from Safespring explore the concept of legal security and its importance for data-driven companies. Gabriel Paues, Cloud Architect, and Amelia Andersdotter, a risk and compliance expert, share their insights.

The dialogue begins with an overview of what legal security entails, specifically in the context of SaaS and PaaS operations. They discuss key aspects such as laws and regulations that affect companies in Sweden and the EU, as well as the long time horizons of legal processes.

Amelia highlights various sources of legal requirements, including the EU level and the Swedish national level. She brings up specific examples such as the General Data Protection Regulation and the Patient Data Act. They also discuss the technical and practical challenges companies face when they must adapt to slow-moving legal changes, and the need for flexible IT infrastructures that can be adjusted when legal requirements change.
