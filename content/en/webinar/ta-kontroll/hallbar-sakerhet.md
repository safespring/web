## Advances in Sustainable Security

{{< ingress >}}
This section provides an overview of how technical solutions can not only secure data but also contribute to more sustainable and environmentally friendly operations. It underscores the importance of designing systems that are robust, efficient, and tailored to reduce their ecological footprint.
{{< /ingress >}}

In this section, Gabriel Paues, Cloud Architect at Safespring, and Amelia Andersdotter, Head of Risk and Compliance, explore how companies can use technology to advance sustainable security. They discuss how sustainability is not only an environmental concept but also an important aspect of technological systems, especially in cloud services and container technology.

The discussion begins with a definition of sustainability in technical terms—not only environmental impact but also efficient use of resources and long-term sustainable investments in technology. Gabriel and Amelia emphasize the importance of using cloud services and modern technologies such as containers to reduce excess infrastructure and improve system efficiency.
