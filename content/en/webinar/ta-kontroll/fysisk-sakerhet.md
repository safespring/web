## Understanding Physical Security

{{< ingress >}}
This section provides a thorough overview of how data-driven companies can protect their physical infrastructure against various threats. Securing the physical environment is essential to safeguard sensitive information and maintain business continuity.
{{< /ingress >}}

In this section, Amelia Andersdotter, Head of Risk and Compliance at Safespring, and Gabriel Paus, Cloud Architect at Safespring, discuss the importance of physical security for data-driven companies. They highlight critical aspects such as data center security, biometric access systems, and reliable cooling, power, and fire suppression systems.

Amelia and Gabriel explore how certifications such as ISO 27001 can verify that subcontractors meet high standards for physical security. They also discuss how physical security serves as a cornerstone of data protection in cloud-based environments, where both physical and logical safeguards must work together to create a robust security framework.
