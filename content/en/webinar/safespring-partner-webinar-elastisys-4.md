We will cover, among other things:

1. What does compliance mean for Kubernetes?
2. What does the lifecycle of a regulatory-compliant application look like?
3. What compliance support do I get from cloud-native tools?

**Johan Tordsson**, CTO at Elastisys and cloud researcher at Umeå University, and **Gabriel Paues**, Cloud Architect at Safespring, walk through how compliance can be achieved in your Kubernetes initiatives. Using local cloud infrastructure and cloud-native tools, they present a practical guide to compliance.
