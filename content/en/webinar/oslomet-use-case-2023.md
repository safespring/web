From DIY to as-a-service in IT education; OsloMET shares experiences transitioning from homegrown automation of VM management to "Safespring Compute (managed Openstack)".
{{< /ingress >}}

The study program in Applied Computer and Information Technology (ACIT) at the Faculty of Technology, Art and Design (TKD), OsloMET has for many years operated its own server virtualization solutions (MLN [1] and Openstack) as tools for experiments related to teaching and research. In January 2023, however, they chose to use Safespring’s IaaS platform, which is based on Openstack, for one of the courses in the spring semester. In this webinar, Associate Professor Hårek Haugerud from OsloMET will talk about the background for the choice and experiences with using the solution in connection with delivering the course in question.

Jarle Bjørgeengen is a Cloud Architect at Safespring and will ask Hårek a number of questions about what it’s like to use the platform. Topics to be covered include how the service meets OsloMET’s needs, what distinguishes the solution from the previous approach, and how this makes the education more relevant. Key topics will include:

- Cost control
- Service-based consumption (as a service)
- Availability and service levels
- Collaboration between the IT department and the teaching department
- Privacy considerations, sensitive data, and sovereignty

Sales Director Kristian Fjellhaug will talk a bit about the setup of the framework agreement via OCRE (Open Clouds for Research Environments) and how it can be consumed by SIKT-affiliated institutions.
