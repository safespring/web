### About the webinar

{{< ingress>}}
During the webinar, we will walk through the lifecycle of a data science project, from pilot to production. To better prepare your organization for the changes that AI technologies bring, it is important to understand the prerequisites.
{{< /ingress >}}

**Daniel Zakrisson** and **Stefan Hellander** from Scaleout will, using STACKn as an example, show how you can take a machine learning project from idea to production in 30 minutes.

Based on their experience supporting and deploying machine learning across academia, startups, and large multinational companies, they will cover, among other things:

- What does idea-to-production (end-to-end) mean in machine learning?
- What is “full-stack machine learning”?
- Lessons learned, best practices, and pitfalls to avoid when taking projects to production
- How machine learning work is an extension of DevOps and integrates with the rest of the company’s development.

### What is STACKn?

STACKn is a new, powerful tech stack that integrates the most widely used open solutions to create a scalable machine learning environment built on cloud-native principles. STACKn covers the entire lifecycle management of a machine learning model and handles automation and orchestration. It is flexible and can be adapted to different environments with ease. It is built to help you get started quickly with machine learning and take AI to production."
