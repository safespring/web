If you missed our session or were unable to attend eFörvaltningsdagarna, we’re pleased to share the recording of our well-received conversation about AI.
{{< /ingress >}}

Fredric Wallsten, CEO of Safespring, and Ebba Kraemer from Scaleout, together with the participants, explored how AI can drive change in the public sector in a responsible way.

Their discussion centered on reconciling technological innovation with the strict requirements for data protection, sovereignty, and sustainability. With Safespring’s infrastructure as the foundation, they showed how Scaleout’s AI platform can strengthen and streamline the work of public administration.

Watch our session and be inspired by how close partnerships can create tomorrow’s solutions.
