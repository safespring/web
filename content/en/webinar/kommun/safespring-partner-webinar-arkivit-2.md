How can we ensure that construction documents will be available in 10 years? Once you’ve accepted the facility or building, the archiving challenge arises.
{{< /ingress >}}

- How do we take care of all construction documentation for 10–15 years?
- How do we ensure it is searchable, unaltered, and accurate?
- How can we find the right project and information that remains readable over time, so we can prove our rights in a dispute with a contractor after eight years?
- How will we be able to find the decisions that have negative consequences and only become apparent after ten years? Why were those decisions made?

How can we manage these volumes of information without having to invest in hardware and software, facilities, and staff expertise?
