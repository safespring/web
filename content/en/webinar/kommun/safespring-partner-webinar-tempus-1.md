### About the webinar

{{< ingress >}}
How can I simplify everyday routines and streamline preschool operations while also giving both parents/guardians and staff more time with the children?
{{</ ingress >}}

Tempus is a proven, easy-to-use system for scheduling, attendance management, and resource planning in preschools. Tempus simplifies daily work and streamlines operations, giving both parents/guardians and staff more time with the children. It can be procured through existing framework agreements.

### In the webinar, we will cover:

1. How Tempus makes work easier in preschool/after-school care
1. Live demo of the service
1. How do I purchase or procure Tempus?

### These are Tempus’ main components:

**Administration & Management** - The Tempus administration portal gives staff, administrators, and principals a clearer picture of operations. Placements, communication with parents/guardians, statistics, and an overview of schools and departments are just some of the features gathered here.

**In daily operations** - With Tempus, staff no longer have to keep track of paper schedules and reminders for parents/guardians. Tempus provides a quick overview of both scheduled time and actual attendance, which facilitates planning and collaboration across departments. With less administration, preschool staff have more time for educational activities with the children!

**For parents/guardians** - Digital scheduling, actual attendance, automatic reminders, and communication with staff are just some of Tempus’ benefits for parents/guardians. Scheduling for preschool has never been easier!
