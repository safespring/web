### About the webinar

{{< ingress>}}
Is it possible to temporarily scale up resource capacity and only pay for the amount and time actually used?
{{< /ingress >}}

One of the most common obstacles in e-archiving is that the producer and/or recipient have underestimated the amount of storage and processing power that may be needed to move, transform, convert, and package the data and digital files to be archived.

If we're dealing with 200,000 digital files at 1.5 MB each, we're talking about roughly 300 GB. We don't want to work with the mirrored files, so we work on copies of them. That creates a need to handle 600 GB. What happens if the initial delivery amounts to 60 TB?

The challenge is that these amounts of extra storage are only needed for a relatively short time. Many IT departments find this hard to handle. You end up having to buy additional storage that you then have to keep paying forâ€”whether you use it or not. In addition, converting the digital files to long-term preservation file formats may also be necessary. This can be resource- and time-intensive, with a substantial need for processing power.
