Imagine if residents could chat with the municipality and get answers to their questions in an instant without pulling a case officer away from their tasks. In the webinar, we introduce ADA, an AI-based digital assistant for the municipality’s case officers.

Apendo Digital Assistant (ADA) is an example of an AI solution that eases the workload of municipal departments. ADA analyzes submitted cases and captures information from residents, analyzes images, and routes cases to the right department within the municipality.

### This is ADA

With ADA, residents and case officers can create cases and get information from the municipality around the clock. In addition to answering complex questions, ADA can also ask for more information so it can forward cases within the municipality with all the details required. Its AI-based foundation enables ADA to analyze text and images, understand context, and relieve case officers in their interactions with residents. Because ADA can handle all incoming cases, case officers can spend more time on tasks that require more hands-on work.

In short:

- **Case classification**  
  Which department should handle the case.
- **Data collection**  
  Customer details, images, location, case data.
- **Communication**  
  Messages to the user and other agencies.
- **Case processing**  
  Can be automated with rules.
