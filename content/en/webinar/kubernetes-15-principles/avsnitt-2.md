## Episode 2

### Managing Pods, Deployments, and StatefulSets

Gabriel Paues from Safespring and Lars Larsson from Elastisys give you a deeper understanding of how Pods, Deployments, and StatefulSets work, and how you can use them to build and scale your applications on Kubernetes. After watching this episode, you will have a solid foundation in managing applications that involve both stateless and stateful components.
