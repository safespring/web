## Benefits of Sunet Backup

1. {{< inline "High security:" >}} Our backups are encrypted in transit with TLS 1.2 and can also be configured for client-side encryption automatically for even higher security.
1. {{< inline "Excellent scalability:" >}} Safespring Backup can protect many terabytes of data with minimal administrative effort thanks to its data lifecycle automation features.
1. {{< inline "Flexible administration:" >}} Our user-friendly self-service portal simplifies setting up new nodes, generating keys, and the hierarchical management of user accounts.
1. {{< inline "Multi-tenancy and role-based access control:" >}} Our solution enables delegation of servers to different parts of the organization and gives IT administrators granular control over access.
1. {{< inline "Advanced reporting and automation:" >}} With our advanced reporting engine and REST-API, you can easily track the status of your backups and automate administrative tasks.
1. {{< inline "Compliance ready:" >}} Safespring Backup runs from Swedish data centers by Safespring, a Swedish company, which protects you from laws such as the CLOUD Act and FISA 720 that would otherwise conflict with GDPR.
