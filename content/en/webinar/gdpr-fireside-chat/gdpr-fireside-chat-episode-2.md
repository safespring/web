{{< ingress>}}
Second session of our popular series! Join us to discuss practical options after Schrems II with Senior Cloud Architect (Gabriel Paues) and Data Protection Officer and IT security expert (Patrik Jonasson). Where do we stand now, and how do we move forward?
{{< /ingress >}}

For about 60 minutes, we’ll discuss why companies using U.S. cloud services have ended up in this legal situation. How should the various messages from providers be interpreted, and what practical methods can companies start working with right now without having to switch cloud service altogether?

Do you have questions specific to your situation? Take this opportunity to ask us—either live during the discussion or anonymously in writing—and we’ll answer you.

Gabriel works at Safespring, which provides a sustainable cloud platform for secure cloud services. Today, Safespring’s infrastructure service is used by, among others, 17 public authorities.

Patrik is CEO and founder of IT-Säkerhetsbolaget AB, a full-service provider in sustainable digitalization with expertise in IT security, information security, ISO audits, IT law, and data protection.
