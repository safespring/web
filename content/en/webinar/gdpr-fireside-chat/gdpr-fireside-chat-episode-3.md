{{< ingress>}}
We cover the EDPB’s guidance following Schrems II. Is the fastest path forward right now cloud services without U.S. ownership or operation? Let’s discuss!
{{< /ingress >}}

A continuation of our popular talk from June 16. Join us to discuss practical options after Schrems II with a Senior Cloud Architect (Gabriel Paues) and a data protection officer and IT security expert (Patrik Jonasson). Where do we stand now, and how do we move forward?

Over roughly 60 minutes, we’ll discuss why organizations using U.S. cloud services have ended up in this legal situation. How should the different messages from vendors be interpreted, and what practical methods can companies start using right now without having to switch cloud providers entirely?

Do you have questions about your specific situation? Take this opportunity to ask us—either live during the discussion or anonymously in text, and we’ll read them out.
