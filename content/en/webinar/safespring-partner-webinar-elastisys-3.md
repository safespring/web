Johan Tordsson, CTO at Elastisys and cloud researcher at Umeå University, walks through the basics of containers, cloud native, and Kubernetes.
{{< /ingress >}}

Drawing on Elastisys’s experience from transformation journeys across a wide range of industries and the CNCF’s Cloud Native Trail Map, Johan covers, among other things:

1. Lessons learned, best practices, and pitfalls to avoid to get the most out of the technology.
1. What is the business case for making this transition?
1. What are the low-hanging fruit?
1. How can organizations approach the change depending on how far along they are on the journey?

Containers and Kubernetes are technologies that are part of the broader approach to software development and operations known as cloud native. This has become extremely popular in recent years and enables faster development cycles, higher availability, and independence from individual cloud providers’ platforms.

Kubernetes is the fastest-growing open-source project in the world, and the one with the most contributors after Linux. The popularity of containers among developers is exploding, and in the coming years the majority of applications will be deployed and consumed as containers.
