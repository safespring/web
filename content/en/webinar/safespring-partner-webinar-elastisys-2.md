{{< ingress>}}
In this webinar, we will take a closer look at how to use Kubernetes in a highly secure way.
{{< /ingress >}}

We will discuss three key areas. After the webinar, you will also have the opportunity to ask questions to our experts on Kubernetes and secure cloud services.

1. Best practices - Kubernetes is not secure 'out of the box.' Which components and configuration are needed to ensure control over your data?
2. Compliant Kubernetes: We will walk through a practical example of how open source can be used to manage your service according to best practices.
3. Two typical customer scenarios in MedTech: Migrating from the US to Europe, and the step from a monolith to microservices.
