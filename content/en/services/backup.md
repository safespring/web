Safespring Backup is a next-generation data backup and recovery solution that leverages the reliability and scalability of IBM Spectrum Protect. 
{{< /ingress >}}

With Safespring Backup, businesses can protect countless terabytes of data with minimal administration effort, thanks to its high security, excellent scalability, and data lifecycle automation features. Our backups are encrypted in transit with TLS 1.2, and can also be configured to be encrypted client-side for even higher security automatically.

### Why Safespring Backup?

Despite being a well-proven solution for large enterprises, traditional backup solutions like Spectrum Protect often lack flexible administration options, particularly when it comes to handling user accounts and role assignments. Safespring Backup addresses this challenge by introducing a user-friendly, self-service portal that simplifies the setup of new nodes, key token generation, and hierarchical user management.

### Solution Overview

With Safespring Backup, we introduce a complete overhaul of the user portal, based on the Auwau Cloutility product, which includes the following features:
- End-user self-service with the ability to create new users, assign roles and privileges, and manage hierarchies of servers.
- Multi-tenancy with role-based access controls for different parts of the hierarchy, enabling delegation of servers to different parts of the organization.
- Provisioning and advanced report engine for easy status tracking and scheduling of reports.
- A REST API for further automation of administrative tasks.

Safespring Backup is a secure, easy-to-use solution that provides businesses with the reliability of Spectrum Protect, and the flexibility of a fully-fledged self-service portal. With advanced features, multi-tenancy, and automation capabilities, Safespring Backup 2.0 is the perfect choice for managing all your backups.
