What makes the collaboration between Elastisys and Safespring so powerful? Rob McCuaig, COO at Elastisys, provides insight into a partnership focused on efficiency, mutual trust, and a belief in storing data exclusively within the EU.

By offering Welkin, a compliance-adapted Kubernetes solution on Safespring’s infrastructure, Elastisys creates customer experiences where users never have to worry about information security.

Rob McCuaig is the COO of the Swedish Elastisys and here, he talks more about the collaboration with Safespring.

## With Welkin, the customer can focus on their own development

Elastisys delivers Kubernetes solutions to customers who need to comply with legal requirements such as GDPR. Their platform, Welkin, enables efficient operations where strict compliance and security requirements prevail. This allows their customers to accelerate the development of new applications while meeting the requirements set by laws such as GDPR and the Patient Data Act.

Elastisys has customers spread across Europe, and therefore, they collaborate with various infrastructure providers, but for Swedish customers, they recommend local providers. Rob explains why:

- We saw an early good match between Elastisys and Safespring. We sell Welkin, and Safespring has the infrastructure that allows our many Swedish customers to meet security requirements.

Safespring's platform is completely free from third-party transfers and helps Elastisys - and indirectly their customers - to comply with GDPR. Elastisys uses tools such as Falco and Gatekeeper for the security of Kubernetes clusters and Argo for customers to deploy new versions of their applications quickly and easily, running smoothly on Safespring.

## Close collaboration creates a good customer experience

Rob states that the collaboration between Elastisys and Safespring is characterized by transparency, a prerequisite in a fast-moving industry where questions, concerns, and regulatory changes constantly arise.

{{< quote "Rob McCuaig, COO at Elastisys" >}}

- For our services to work optimally for our customers, close communication with Safespring is crucial. We meet several times a year, have quick communication channels for both development and business issues, and value each other’s feedback.

### Helping to solve the customer’s challenges

Elastisys is usually the primary contact in the joint projects, but when their end customer needs additional information about the infrastructure security policy, Safespring, accustomed to working with the public sector, is quick to provide local support through direct chat with the developers. Rob elaborates:

- Our customers don’t have ongoing contact with Safespring, and that is a good sign. But when situations arise where the customer has specific questions, such as during a public procurement, they quickly get a good response from Safespring. The result is that the customer doesn’t have to delve into long supplier chains but quickly finds out what they need.

{{% note "Rob’s 3 tips for choosing a cloud provider" %}}

### 1. Have the same values

When choosing a provider, select a partner who has the same mentality as your company. If both of you care about, for example, European solutions, you have good prerequisites to reach a consensus on new issues that arise.

### 2. Transparency - a prerequisite

Just because you have common values, it doesn’t mean that the collaboration works well in practice; mutual openness is also required. So choose a partner who is as interested in your business as you are in theirs.

### 3. Proximity wins

Choose a partner who values working closely with you. Your senior developers should easily contact the provider's - this can lead to good cooperation, easy communication, and value-creating deliveries.
