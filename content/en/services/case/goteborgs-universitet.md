Safespring Backup has been released in a new version that helps our customers gain better oversight. By organizing in a hierarchical structure, the University of Gothenburg can track consumption and also set its own rules for internal billing.

"With the new service, we get a completely different overview of consumption. We can go in in real time and see how different parts of the organization use the service," says a member of the project team at the University of Gothenburg.

"By setting up an internal hierarchy, we can choose to look at the organization as a whole or at its parts. This makes cost control easier. Previously, it was difficult to get an overview of which departments were driving consumption."

Safespring Backup uses the leading solution Cloutility to deliver its service. Users can be given responsibility for their part of the organization and see exactly how much they consume. Cloutility provides a complete administration page with extensive options for customization.

"We also appreciate being able to change the appearance of the service so it comes across as our own," "It makes the experience more consistent and enables us to offer the service more easily to other parts of the organization."

The University of Gothenburg currently uses the service for around 30 servers and stores approximately 23 TB in the service. All data travels within SUNET's high-speed fiber network.

Safespring Backup gives customers more control and greater peace of mind. All data is stored on Safespring's servers within national borders, in accordance with the provisions and regulations that apply in Sweden.
