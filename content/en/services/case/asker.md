Asker aids its clients in making better recruitment decisions with the help of AI.

But with smart solutions comes great responsibility: to store personal information and sensitive data securely. At Safespring, Asker gets a secure base to store and run its platform – and this secure environment also helps them win more business.

Alex Tidgård, founder and CPO of Asker and a licensed psychologist, shares more about the collaboration with Safespring.

### Better Candidate Selection with AI-Driven Platform at Safespring

With its AI-driven interview platform, Asker helps managers and recruitment teams find the right person for the job. Asker's automatic interview notes, AI-based interview guides, and an interview structure based on the latest research ensure their clients save time, reduce biases, and build efficient interview processes. For each interview conducted, data is collected which Asker then uses to help clients make more objective decisions – and all data is stored at Safespring.

In the public sector, Swedish data storage is often a requirement, but even in the private sector, awareness of compliance and information security is increasing. That's why we wanted to work with the safest option we could find – and that's Safespring.

Alex talks about how the demands for data security have increased among their clients, and the importance of making security-related decisions early:

“The heightened security situation makes people more concerned about their data and their suppliers. In the public sector, Swedish data storage is often a requirement, but even in the private sector, awareness of compliance and information security is increasing. That's why we wanted to work with the safest option we could find – and that's Safespring.”

### No news is good news – the collaboration runs smoothly on its own

Safespring is the foundation for Asker. On the GDPR-secure servers, all sensitive data, personal information, and even the AI platform itself are stored. Asker also collaborates with Elastisys, a Kubernetes platform service provider, and together the companies have made Asker completely independent of underlying suppliers.

Onboarding and implementation were easy. Alex explains:

_"The move to Elastisys involved some manual work, but the collaboration with Safespring was just a button press. We haven't heard from them since then, and 'no news is good news'. It runs on its own."_

### Asker Meets Customers' Demands for a Swedish Cloud Solution

In the sales process, Alex experiences that Safespring elevates Asker's offering because the Swedish solution has an appeal to their clients:

{{< quote "Alex Tidgård, CPO at Asker" >}}
“The discussion about information security with our potential clients is usually brief. Since we immediately show that we work towards a Swedish cloud storage service that is GDPR-compliant, there are rarely any follow-up questions. They can't find a safer solution than storage at Safespring. I also feel that it opens doors to clients who wouldn't have met with us if we couldn't demonstrate our collaboration with Safespring.”

When questions about information security do arise, Safespring is readily available. Alex describes the service as good, competent, and fast, which contrasts with large American providers where the response both takes time and is less personal.

### 1. Transfer Data Early

Even though the law surrounding data storage is still split between the EU and the Patriot Act, you can expect it to continue being regulated. Make the move before you suddenly realize you are breaking new laws and regulations.

### 2. Think Long-Term

The longer you wait to make the move, the larger and more burdensome the work becomes. So don't wait too long.

### 3. Keep an Eye on the AI Act

Right now,

there are no EU-specific regulations related to AI, but it's only a matter of time before there are laws you need to comply with. Therefore, stay up to date with the regulations and choose a solution that helps you meet the requirements. The safest thing you can do is to choose Swedish!
