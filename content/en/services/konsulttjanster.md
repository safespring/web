<div class="ingress"><p>Creating secure and well-functioning cloud services with open source requires high-level expertise, as many components need to be integrated. At Safespring, we have that expertise and can therefore offer advanced consulting services to help your company with its cloud strategy.</p></div>

At Safespring, we are passionate about creating value around the services we deliver. We are happy to share our expertise on how to make the best use of our services. This covers everything from capacity planning to comprehensive strategies for building your solution so that it scales and fully leverages the power of our capacity services.

We also share our experience on how to structure processes to work according to DevOps principles. The consulting engagement includes an analysis of your current development processes and a report describing which areas you need to focus on, along with a realistic target state.

We also have partners who offer backup services—either as a local solution, our cloud-based solution, or a combination for increased security. In this area, we can also develop solutions for continuous recovery testing to ensure the backups you take actually work. These tests can be combined with our Compute platform so you only pay for resources when you run the tests—keeping costs down while maintaining peace of mind.

We also offer consulting services in AI and ML (Machine Learning). Through our strong ties to academia, we have partners at the cutting edge of these fields. By combining these services with Safespring’s cloud services, you can find a way to leverage these technologies while keeping data within the country’s borders. If that’s not sufficient, we can also help set up a platform in your data center (managed by us) that gives you full control over where the data resides, while providing a short ramp-up time to get started with these technologies.

## Examples of consulting services

### Before a project

Safespring helps by conducting an initial assessment to map your current solution. We also demonstrate how to inventory your data to ensure you get the best solution tailored to your conditions. The results of the assessment provide guidelines for how the work and your new solution should be designed.

### During a project

Are you about to procure capacity services, or do you need to expand an existing system? We have experience with Hybrid Cloud, where our services can form part of your overall infrastructure. Through implementation and onboarding, we ensure our platforms seamlessly contribute to a local, flexible, and secure part of your current solution. We can provide project management to ensure the work follows the plan and no technical milestones fall through the cracks. Read more about what our customers say about past projects:

### Customization

Speak directly with a cloud architect to dive deeper into how we can support and streamline the process. With each passing month, the possibilities and expertise in the cloud computing market evolve. We help you modernize your existing systems and can provide an overview of the possibilities with DevOps, containers, various management platforms, etc.

Ways of working that involve automation and APIs can streamline and reduce the costs of your systems. Our platform is based on open source through OpenStack. This means we are continuously modernizing, and we are happy to help you move forward on that journey.

Contact us to specify your particular needs, and let’s see how we can make your use of capacity services more efficient.
