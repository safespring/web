## Why Choose Welkin?
Kubernetes in its purest form is not secure. Welkin is tailored to ISO27001 standards, which means it is designed for maximum security and observability from the start.

## Background
{{< ingress >}}
There are many reasons why companies choose to bring their data home to Europe.
{{< /ingress >}}

Most SaaS services contain personal data such as names, telephone numbers, home addresses and in many cases patient records which need to be handled with great care.

Personal data is regulated by the Data Protection Regulation in Sweden, GDPR and the Patient Data Law. Are you handling patient and medical records without complying with GDPR?

If the service managing personal data is hosted on an American cloud service, the healthcare institution is violating the Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) according to the EU court's ruling in July 2020.

Therefore, Sweden's regions and municipalities set clear requirements that personal data must be stored with Swedish cloud service providers who offer the same capacity and flexibility as the major international alternatives. Swedish cloud platforms like Safespring store data in Sweden and are governed by Swedish law.

Boost your competitiveness in Europe with the right cloud service and increase your sales.
