### Features
CCX includes an easy-to-use provisioning and deployment process, allowing you to set up high-availability databases with just a few clicks. Failover and auto-recovery mechanisms ensure that downtime-creating issues are detected and resolved automatically. With backup and disaster recovery capabilities, your data remains protected, minimizing disruption in case of failure. 

Scaling is seamless, enabling you to expand or reduce storage and replicas as your workload demands. Firewall and security protections keep your databases safe, featuring encryption and controlled access. Additionally, database user management simplifies role and access control to enhance security. 

For performance monitoring, observability dashboards provide insights into your database performance, helping you pinpoint issues efficiently. Query monitoring tools allow for optimization by identifying top queries and troubleshooting resource-intensive processes.
