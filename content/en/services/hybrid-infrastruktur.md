<div class="ingress"><p>Having to invest in infrastructure that’s only needed during traffic spikes a few times a year can get expensive. At the same time, there are good reasons to keep control of the services your company offers its customers.</p></div>

A popular way to handle irregular traffic patterns while retaining control is to use a private cloud that can be supplemented with a public one when needed. This is called Hybrid Cloud. Since Safespring’s services are delivered locally, you can safely let our cloud handle peak loads while maintaining your own control.

This has long sounded good on paper but been harder to implement. With the adoption of containers and container frameworks such as Kubernetes, the approach to Hybrid Cloud has become much simpler.

### Kubernetes as the foundation

By using the same foundation—containers and Kubernetes—both in your own environment and in the public cloud used to complement it, the approach becomes standardized regardless of where the application runs. Kubernetes also supports load balancers and autoscaling when needed, which makes the implementation robust.

### Move your environment easily

The method of using Kubernetes as the foundation can also be used to mix and match different cloud platforms. In such cases, it becomes easy to move some or all resources to another provider.

Given the uncertain situation around the use of non-European cloud services, we at Safespring see great potential in building solutions this way, so you can quickly move them either to your own data center or to a local provider to efficiently handle changes in the legal landscape.
