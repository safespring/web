Discover the power of Safespring Storage — an S3-compatible object storage solution designed to meet the demands of European organisations. With a focus on compliance, scalability, and performance, Safespring Storage provides a reliable foundation for your data storage needs.

With **data encryption**, you can safeguard your data with end-to-end encryption, ensuring integrity and confidentiality during transit and at rest. Our **object locking** feature protects your critical data from accidental deletion or ransomware attacks by making objects immutable for a specified period.

Cloud native applications rely on low-latency data retrieval and high-speed transfers. Our **optimized transfers** enable efficient data handling through performance optimizations like parallel uploads and multipart transfers.

Additionally, our solution provides easy integration with existing S3 tools and applications, eliminating the need for modifications. With wide application support, Safespring Storage is compatible with popular software like Veeam Backup, Nextcloud, Cyberduck, and more.

## Safespring Storage comes in two versions

Do your application need high speed access to the stored data or are you looking for a long-term storage solution for an offsite-backup?
