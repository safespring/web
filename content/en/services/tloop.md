## Questions and answers about T.Loop

T.Loop stands for Therma Loop, indicating that they view the conversion of energy from electricity to heat and redundancy as ways to reduce the CO2 footprint, while providing co-location customers with modern infrastructure for IaaS services.

{{% question question="What is a Data Energy Center®?" %}}
T.Loop coined the term Data Energy Center® (DEC) to focus on the data center’s crucial role in our energy system and, above all, to harness all idle and surplus energy and capacity produced by many data centers today.

They see these solutions as a qualified way to use the Data Energy Center® as a source for heating buildings and cities, while the largely idle resources in emergency and backup power can be used to balance the power grid. To achieve a high sustainability rating, their technology is primarily based on liquid cooling, smart software, heat recovery, fuel cells, and batteries for backup. They take the carbon out of computing!
{{% /question %}}

{{% question question="What sets T.Loop’s co-location services apart from traditional data centers?" %}}
They design and build their Data Energy Center® with sustainability and energy recovery in mind. They use circular thinking in construction by using existing installations in already built facilities. They see the data center not only as a secure place for servers and storage, but also as part of the energy system. Thus, with a robust infrastructure, they avoid fossil-based support systems.
{{% /question %}}

{{% question question="What differentiates T.Loop’s co-location services in the market?" %}}
They make your IT more sustainable by putting energy circularity at the heart of their data center design, without compromising the criticality of data center operations.

- Their design significantly reduces energy consumption where possible.
- They place their Data Energy Centers® in existing buildings and use existing power and communications infrastructure, resulting in a low embodied CO₂ footprint in construction.
- By integrating a Data Energy Center® into the property, surplus heat from the servers can heat the building directly, without using electricity for heat pumps.
- They contribute to grid balancing by using the Data Energy Center® power infrastructure to help stabilize the grid and provide extra capacity.
- They place Data Energy Centers® close to the data source to meet low‑latency requirements.
- They increase availability by interconnecting multiple Data Energy Centers®, providing better redundancy and more choices for customers.

In summary, they offer less carbon in compute, less carbon in buildings, and healthier energy grids!
{{% /question %}}

{{% question question="How much lower CO₂ can Safespring Private Cloud at T.Loop offer compared to my current installation?" %}}
They can help you calculate your current climate footprint if they receive details about your usage. Primarily, the calculated CO₂ is based on your PUE and how many kWh you use. If you need help, please <a href="mailto:daniel.melin@safespring.com">contact Daniel Melin at Safespring</a>.
{{% /question %}}

{{% question question="Does T.Loop also offer Data Energy Centers® for Safespring On-Prem Cloud?" %}}
