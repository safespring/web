# What Is Life Science?

Life science, or livsvetenskap in Swedish, is a broad and versatile field of research that encompasses the study of all living things. This area includes a range of different disciplines and subjects, some of which are:

1. **Biology:** The study of life and living organisms, including their structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, and distribution. It lies at the core of life science and is grounded in understanding lifeâ€™s fundamental processes.
2. **Biomedicine:** This field focuses on understanding, diagnosing, and treating diseases. Biomedicine includes research into disease mechanisms as well as the development of medical treatments and therapies.
3. **Genetics:** The study of inheritance and the role of genes in living organisms. Genetics plays an important role in understanding how traits and diseases are passed from one generation to the next.
4. **Microbiology:** Focuses on microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. This area is important for understanding infectious diseases, ecosystem function, and biotechnological applications.
5. **Neuroscience:** The study of the nervous system, including the brain. This field aims to understand how the nervous system works and how it influences behavior and cognition.
6. **Pharmacology:** The science of drugs, their effects, and how they are used to treat diseases.
7. **Molecular Biology:** Studies at the molecular level to understand cellular function and how it is affected by various factors.

Life science is important to many areas, including medicine, agriculture, environmental science, and biotechnology. Research in this field helps improve human health and quality of life, as well as understand and preserve our natural environment.

## SciLifeLab _(Science for Life Laboratory)_

SciLifeLab is a Swedish national center for molecular biosciences and life science research. It was founded in 2010 by four leading universities in Sweden:

- Karolinska Institutet,
- KTH Royal Institute of Technology,
- Stockholm University, and
- Uppsala University.

SciLifeLab supports and conducts research in life science by providing advanced technology, infrastructure, and expertise. They focus on a wide range of research areas, including genetics, biomedicine, infectious diseases, and bioinformatics. SciLifeLab also plays an important role in collaborations between academia, industry, and healthcare to promote innovation and the application of research findings within life science.
