## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - Modern solutions for your IT needs

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud-based service that offers a high level of flexibility and scalability for businesses. Instead of investing in physical data centers and servers, companies rent these resources as a fully scalable service. This means you can tailor your IT infrastructure to your specific needs and only pay for the resources you actually use.

### The difference between IaaS and colocation

IaaS differs from colocation, where companies still have to own and maintain their own physical equipment, even if it is housed in an external data center. While colocation can offer advantages in terms of customization and control, it also entails significant capital expenditures and responsibility for maintenance and upgrades. This can be a major burden for smaller companies or those that need to adapt quickly to changing business environments.

With Safespring Compute, our IaaS solution, you have access to robust, secure, and flexible server capacity whenever you need it. Whether you need to scale up to handle a spike in demand or quickly launch a new service, Safespring Compute gives you the flexibility you need to stay competitive. In addition, with all data securely stored within Swedenâ€™s borders, you can be confident that your company always complies with local data protection laws.
