{{< ingress >}}
Egress cost refers to the cost of sending data from the cloud to a user's device or another cloud service outside the specific cloud.

The cost of uploading and downloading data is an important factor to consider when using cloud services. By being aware of it and planning for it in advance, you can avoid unwanted expenses and maximize cost-effectiveness in your use of cloud services.

### Why is egress cost an important factor to consider when using cloud services?

First, it can be an unexpected expense for users who aren’t aware it exists. Egress cost can add significant expenses to a company’s budget, and this can be hard to predict or plan for. Second, it can influence the choice of which IaaS provider to use. Since egress costs can vary between cloud providers, it can affect which option is most cost-effective for a specific organization or use case.

Traffic charges can act as a lock-in mechanism for cloud providers, as customers may find it difficult to switch due to the high costs of outbound traffic. This makes it important to consider both direct and indirect costs when choosing a cloud provider.
