<div class="ingress"><p>Safespring is planning to maintain uninterrupted operations.</p></div>

Safespring has staff in Norway and Sweden. A contingency group has been set up to monitor developments and the measures being taken by the Norwegian and Swedish authorities.

Safespring’s staff can work from home and have the tools needed to perform their duties from home.

Daily meetings and operations are conducted via video calls by default. Staff working from home does not affect the operation of our platform.

### Measures taken

**On 27 February** employees were informed to prepare for a potentially extended period of working from home.

**On 11 March** Safespring entered a contingency mode in which employees may be asked to work from home at short notice. Technical staff are recommended to work from home to remain isolated from one another.

- We are in close dialogue with our subcontractors to ensure they have a plan for continued operations.
- Employees who have been in a risk area have worked from home for at least two weeks, in line with the Public Health Agency’s recommendations.
- For the time being, we have canceled travel and participation in conferences, regardless of size.
