The CLOUD Act is a new US law that allows government agencies to request data from US cloud service companies regardless of the country in which the data is stored. Even if a company uses AWS in Sweden, data can be handed over to the United States.

Safespring is one of several local cloud service providers that operate in the same country as the data and the customer, which ensures the data is protected under local legislation and is not subject to the CLOUD Act.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is concerned about this development and has published a [blog post warning about the CLOUD Act][effcloudact].

If you want to read more about how the CLOUD Act affects Swedish and Norwegian companies, Mattias Malmqvist has written [an article about the CLOUD Act][cloudact] for IDG that is worth reading.
