Safespring, in collaboration with Atea, Binero, Cleura, Ericsson, Saab, the Swedish Tax Agency, the Swedish Transport Administration, and the Swedish Transport Agency, is joining Sweden’s IT Operations Network, an initiative aimed at strengthening the country’s IT operations capacity and boosting interest in IT infrastructure, data centers, and cloud services.

Sweden faces a challenge: the shortage of skills and resources in IT operations hinders the country’s ability to be self-sufficient in this critical sector. By increasing knowledge and expanding the talent pool in the field, we aim to enhance Sweden’s competitiveness.

The goal of Sweden’s IT Operations Network is to attract more workers to the industry over the long term. Through joint marketing and engaging activities such as seminars and hackathons, as well as dialogue with and support for stakeholders who can influence developments, such as universities, we hope to achieve this goal. An important part of the initiative also includes continuously developing our own expertise.

Safespring strives to always be at the forefront in adhering to EU standards for data protection and privacy. We believe it is our duty to ensure that our operations and solutions align with EU rules and regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Cybersecurity Act. We consider this not only important for our business, but also for strengthening the trust of our customers and partners.

A simple yet powerful analogy for understanding the importance of IT operations—and the consequences of lacking skills and resources—is to think of a country that cannot build and maintain its own roads and railways. Just as these fundamental capabilities are essential to a functioning society, strong IT operations are critical to a resilient, well-functioning economy. Sweden’s IT Operations Network aims to rally efforts to ensure robust Swedish IT operations.

As part of this initiative, Safespring contributes its longstanding commitment to digital sovereignty, data protection, and privacy. By adhering to EU standards, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Cybersecurity Act, Safespring helps create a secure, inclusive, and sustainable digital environment with human rights at its core.

We are proud to be part of this collective effort and look forward to working together to achieve our goals.
