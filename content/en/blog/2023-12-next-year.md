As 2023 draws to a close, we at Safespring would like to take the opportunity to look back at the year’s progress and look ahead to what 2024 may bring.
{{< /ingress >}}

This year has been marked by significant advances in cloud services, with each new step guided by our vision to deliver innovative, high-quality solutions.

### Private Cloud for RISE

Our collaboration with RISE (Research Institutes of Sweden) has been a milestone this year. Through this partnership, we created a Managed Private Cloud solution specifically tailored to handle large volumes of data from space telescopes. This project not only underscores our expertise in customized cloud solutions, but also demonstrates our ability to meet unique and demanding needs. It is a prime example of how our tailored services can contribute to impactful research and innovation.

### European Science Cloud is being built in part by Safespring

Another important part of our work this year was winning a contract in the procurement of the infrastructure for the European Open Science Cloud. In this prominent collaboration with the Polish PSNC, we will deliver key resources and develop a new managed container platform. This initiative is not only a milestone for Safespring, it also lays the foundation for new opportunities that will benefit our customers and the broader development of our services.

### Stronger container offering than ever

To further strengthen our position in cloud technology, we have also expanded our network of partnerships this year. Collaborations with companies such as Sudo, Stakater, and Elastisys have enabled us to offer even more specialized tools and services for container management and orchestration. Through these partnerships, we ensure that our customers always have access to the latest innovations and best solutions in cloud technology.

### Kubernetes webcast

One of the year’s most notable webcasts is our series on Kubernetes, led by our Cloud Architect Gabriel in collaboration with Lars from Elastisys. The seven-part series not only offers in-depth knowledge of this technology, but has also become a platform to showcase our expertise and capacity for innovation. It exemplifies how we continuously strive to educate and inform about the latest trends and technologies in the cloud space.

See all episodes of the series [Design and deployment of scalable applications on Kubernetes](/webinar/kubernetes-15-principles).

With these advances in mind, we look forward to 2024 with great anticipation. Thank you for your continued trust and support, and we look forward to continuing our journey together toward new heights in cloud technology and innovation.
