Can a cloud service be open, standardized, flexible, secure, and lawful at the same time? For us at Safespring, the answer is of course yes.

Our services are based on open source, designed around open standards, and are easy to combine. Our infrastructure—and our corporate domicile—is in Europe. Therefore, there is no ambiguity about which laws apply when we provide services to our customers. Predictability, solid update and testing routines, and long experience, distributed among skilled staff in three European countries, give us one of the highest levels of security available on the market today. Not just technically but also legally, we can guarantee sustainability in service delivery for the foreseeable future.

Yet our operations today face a number of obstacles caused not least by political indecision.

In many public-sector organizations, legal certainty is set aside if it entails changes to the existing IT infrastructure. That is anti-competitive, and a clear European regulatory framework with an ever-stronger focus on European digital sovereignty has not yet succeeded in strengthening Swedish cloud services.

It has also proven difficult to shift focus from investments in, for example, broadband to initiatives that support new Swedish companies and business opportunities. We call for drive and vision. For a successful digitalization, it’s not just cables but also the content that flows through them that is needed.

- A holistic perspective on Sweden’s digitalization, Swedish cloud services, and Swedish industry requires that not only technical but also legal security be accorded legitimacy.
- It’s not only those of us in the private sector but also politicians and the public sector who need to believe in Swedish companies’ ability to deliver.
- The more we believe in ourselves, the brighter the future. Want to know more about Swedish cloud services? Get in touch and let’s talk!
