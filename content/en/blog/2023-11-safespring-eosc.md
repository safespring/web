Safespring, as a subcontractor to Poznań Supercomputing and Networking Center (PSNC), is proud to announce our role on the winning team for the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) procurement, an initiative aimed at enhancing and facilitating scientific research collaboration in Europe. The contract has an estimated value of approximately €32 million over three years.

In this project, our task is to provide infrastructure and platform services to the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), a platform that facilitates the sharing of scientific data and research resources across Europe. Safespring’s involvement spans two main areas:

1. {{< inline "Infrastructure services" >}} We contribute digital infrastructure such as container services, cloud storage, and virtual servers, enabling secure and efficient storage and management of research data and operation of the open research cloud.
2. {{< inline "Application services" >}} We provide the infrastructure for the software solutions that support collaboration and data analysis, making it easier for researchers to analyze and visualize their results without losing control of their data.

### The purpose of a shared research cloud

The European Commission’s aim with EOSC is to achieve a federation of infrastructures that provides seamless access to interoperable tools for end-to-end research data lifecycle management, from discovery to storage, management, analysis, and reuse.

{{< quote "Fredric Wallsten, CEO of Safespring" >}}
"EOSC reflects the core values of the EU’s Digital Decade targets for 2030. My hope is that these initiatives will reduce the public sector’s hesitancy toward cloud services and promote their broader adoption."
