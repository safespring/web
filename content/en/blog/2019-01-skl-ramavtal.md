## New framework agreement for e-archive as a service.

The recent debate about the Cloud Act and foreign cloud services has made many in the public sector think twice when implementing digital systems. Many have asked for more guidance on what they can choose following eSam’s statement about the risks of the cloud.

With the new framework agreement, in which ArkivIT is the contracting party with SKL, as many as 952 call-off eligible authorities can use secure Swedish cloud services through Safespring without data leaving the country. Please read the press release to see what this means.
