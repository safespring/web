In a previous post, we discussed the billion-euro fine against Meta, Facebook’s parent company. But legal reviews of U.S. companies in relation to European law are underway not only across Europe, but also here at home.

## Outsourcing is currently under review at the Administrative Court in Växjö

In short, it is a legality review in which a citizen of Region Kalmar has questioned whether outsourcing IT infrastructure to Microsoft, in coordination with Region Skåne, is compatible with European data protection as well as Swedish public access to information and secrecy rules. What we want to focus on here are certain aspects of the technical expert report the citizen has relied on.

U.S. law applies to companies with operations and headquarters in the United States, not to hardware located on U.S. territory. A data center in Ireland therefore falls under U.S. law if it is operated by a U.S. company. Under European law, European citizens’ data fall under European law regardless of where or by whom they are stored or processed. For U.S. cloud services, you must take U.S. legislation into account when assessing the legal security of using those services.

In the United States, more than 20,000 government agencies can request data for a wide range of purposes, including law enforcement, national security, and surveillance. In practice, it is not possible to find out when and whether, or why, a U.S. company has complied with requests. U.S. legislation limits when companies are allowed to disclose such matters.

As soon as a public authority outsources IT services to a cloud provider, data are transferred to the provider’s servers. For many cloud services—such as issuing public transport tickets, email, or case management—personal data must be made available to the provider in a form they can process. The data must be unencrypted and readable.

When activities fall under European law, there is an obligation to be able to inform the citizen when a disclosure has occurred and why. U.S. cloud services have few options for complying with both sets of laws at the same time. For a long time, the EU and Sweden handled this by ignoring their own laws. Only after Donald Trump’s presidency did EU countries begin to see if and when U.S. security interests do not always align with their own.

That is where the value of the Meta fine becomes apparent—both for European legislation, European citizens’ rights, the functioning of European public authorities and, of course, for us as European providers of confidential, modern IT infrastructure. U.S. competitors should not be given advantages because European and Swedish laws are not followed. And our legislation here at home is legitimate, both from the perspective of democratic governance and in terms of citizens’ rights.
