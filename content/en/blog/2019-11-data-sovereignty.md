### Investigation into IT contracts: stronger cooperation to better protect rights

**2019-10-21** / EDPS / [Link to article](https://edps.europa.eu/press-publications/press-news/press-releases/2019/edps-investigation-it-contracts-stronger_en)

- In April 2019, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) launched an investigation into the use of Microsoft products and services by EU institutions.
- Though the investigation is still ongoing, preliminary results reveal serious concerns over the compliance of the relevant contractual terms with data protection rules and the role of Microsoft as a processor for EU institutions using its products and services.
- The Hague Forum aims to discuss both how to take back control over the IT services and products offered by the big IT service providers and the need to collectively create standard contracts instead of accepting the terms and conditions as they are written.

### DIGG makes policy decision on open source

**2019-05-15** / DIGG News / [Link to article](https://www.digg.se/nyheter--publikationer/nyheter/digg-tar-policybeslut-kring-oppen-kallkod)

- A policy decision has been adopted that software developed and/or procured for the agency’s operations should primarily be published as open source.
- “We want to be open and accessible and make it easier for our partners both here in the country and across borders to benefit from the knowledge we have built up, not least in cross-border e-identification carried out within eIDAS,” says Anna Eriksson, Director General at DIGG.
- By being open with our source code, we can make things easier for our partners and together increase the pace of digitalization without compromising security, she continues.

### Gaia-X - Europe Is Starting to Declare Its Cloud Independence

**2019-10-30** / Fortune / [Link to article](https://fortune.com/2019/10/30/europe-cloud-independence-gaia-x-germany-france/)

- Tired of its businesses turning to foreign cloud-computing providers such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, the German government is leading the push for a European cloud network called Gaia-X. France is also on board.
- “Data will be the most important raw material of the future,” said German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier in a statement this week. “The European economy urgently needs an infrastructure that ensures data sovereignty.”

### What’s driving Europe’s new aggressive stance on tech

**2019-10-29** / Politico / [Link to article](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-digital-technological-sovereignty-facebook-google-amazon-ursula-von-der-leyen/)

- President Ursula von der Leyen is determined to bolster the EU’s ability to compete head on with the United States and China on all things digital.
- That strategy includes taking a tougher stance on foreigners scooping up European tech firms, using government contracts as a “strategic” tool to allow local rivals to compete with international firms like Amazon, and super-charging the bloc’s industrial policy to fuel innovation in fields such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing.
- She's even come up with a name for it: technological sovereignty.

### France recruits Dassault Systemes, OVH for alternative to U.S. firms

**2019-10-03** / Euro news / [Link to article](https://www.euronews.com/2019/10/03/france-recruits-dassault-systemes-ovh-for-alternative-to-us-cloud-firms)

- France has enlisted tech companies Dassault Systemes and OVH to come up with plans to break the dominance of U.S. companies in cloud computing
- Dassault Systemes is a French software company and OVH is a privately held French cloud computing company.
- Paris is concerned a 2018 U.S. law called the Cloud Act lets any U.S. agency access European corporate data that is stored on the data centres of U.S. companies without telling them.

### Germany’s plan to control its own data

**2019-09-12** / Politico / [Link to article](https://www.politico.eu/article/germanys-plan-to-control-its-own-data-digital-infrastructure/)

- Berlin aspires to become a world leader in industrial or business-to-business data technology, a goal that senior industrialists argue will be difficult to achieve if foreign powers control the storage of sensitive data and can use their supremacy to pressure Germany.
- The strategy, which includes a project to develop a European cloud-hosting service named Gaia-X, aims to address growing alarm over the reliance of large firms, government services and even police forces on hosts such as Amazon to store their data.

### DigiPlex: Heavy cloud cover in the public sector – no one has an overview of data centers

**2019-11-03** / Finansavisen / [Link to article](https://finansavisen.no/meninger/debattinnlegg/2019/11/03/7468317/digiplex-tungt-skydekke-i-offentlig-sektor-ingen-har-oversikt-over-datasentre)

- The public sector’s handling of data centers is completely in the dark, says Gisle M. Eckhoff at DigiPlex.
- The public sector in Norway probably has just under 200 data centers. Exactly how many there are, where they are located, how the security works, or how much energy they use—no one has an overview. Both the environment and taxpayers would benefit from a cleanup.

### Lars Strand, NSM: Critical infrastructure

**2019-10-27** / Finansavisen / [Link to article](https://finansavisen.no/meninger/debattinnlegg/2019/10/27/7466505/lars-strand-nsm-kritisk-infrastruktur)

## CLOUD Act

<h3 style="color: var(--link-color);">Official statements</h3>

### Joint Response to the LIBE Committee on US Cloud Act

**2019-07-19** / EPDB / [Link to article](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/letters/epdb-edps-joint-response-libe-committee-impact-us-cloud-act_en)

- “We also stress the need for an EU-level approach. In this specific context, as massive amounts of electronic communication data are processed and stored by operators falling under US jurisdiction and since direct access requests sent by US authorities are likely to affect any Member State, an EU-level approach is essential here in order to avoid the potential negative consequences of a fragmented patchwork of non-harmonised bilateral executive agreements between the US and EU Member States that would be concluded under the US CLOUD Act”.

### European Data Protection Board - Twelfth Plenary session

**2019-07-11** / EPDB / [Link to article](https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2019/european-data-protection-board-twelfth-plenary-session_en)

- The CLOUD Act allows US law enforcement authorities to require the disclosure of data by service providers in the US, regardless of where the data is stored. The EDPB and EDPS emphasize that a comprehensive EU-US agreement regarding cross-border access to electronic evidence, containing strong procedural and substantial safeguards for fundamental rights, appears the most appropriate instrument to ensure the necessary level of protection for EU data subjects and legal certainty for businesses.

### eSam sees risks with cloud services in the public sector

**2018-11-12** / eSam / [Link to article](http://www.esamverka.se/nyheter/nyheter/2018-11-12-esam-ser-risker-med-molntjanster-i-offentlig-sektor.html)

- A group within eSam has, since spring 2018, worked on how the public sector can use cloud services based on security and confidentiality legislation and what recommendations eSam can give its members and other actors in the public sector.

### #3 Microsoft changes its mind “Incorrect interpretation of the CLOUD Act”

**2019-09-22** / André Catry / [Link to article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/3-microsoft-%C3%A4ndrar-%C3%A5sikt-felaktig-tolkning-av-clarifying-andr%C3%A9-catry/)

- In 2013, Microsoft argued that they could not disclose information stored in Ireland to U.S. authorities. Today that does not seem to be a problem.

### #2 Continuation “Incorrect interpretation of (CLOUD Act)”

**2019-09-17** / André Catry / [Link to article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/2-felaktig-tolkning-av-clarifying-lawful-overseas-use-andr%C3%A9-catry/)

### #1 Incorrect interpretation of (CLOUD Act)

**2019-09-14** / André Catry / [Link to article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/felaktig-tolkning-av-clarifying-lawful-overseas-use-data-andr%25C3%25A9-catry/?trackingId=K0pdllVWQMeaHHtY6RELWg%3D%3D)

- “Now I intend to respond to writers who are experienced jurists and even, in some cases, attorneys. Moreover, I am doing it on their home turf—the interpretation of legal text. However, I feel that the writers have somehow gone wrong or chosen to interpret the factual circumstances in such a way that I perceive it is intended to fit a particular purpose.”
