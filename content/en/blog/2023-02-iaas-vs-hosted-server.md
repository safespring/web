In this article, we take a closer look at what a hosted server and IaaS are, and why IaaS can be a better solution for your needs, especially when it comes to hosting and servers.

## What Is a Hosted Server?

A hosted server is a service where an external provider supplies a physical server located in their data center. The customer accesses the server via a web interface and is allocated a certain amount of bandwidth, memory, and storage capacity. The customer does not own the server and is not responsible for its maintenance.

## What Is Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)?

IaaS is a service in which a provider delivers a virtual infrastructure that includes virtual servers, storage, networking, and other resources the customer needs to run their applications or services. The customer controls the virtual resources and can scale up or down as needed. The customer does not own the physical infrastructure but is responsible for operating the virtual infrastructure.

### Benefits of IaaS

There are many advantages to IaaS compared to a hosted server:

- **Scalability**: the scalability of a cloud server makes it easy to scale up or down based on your needs.
- **Cost savings**: by choosing a cloud service, you can save money by avoiding investments in and maintenance of your own physical infrastructure.
- **Flexibility**: a cloud server service gives you full control over your virtual infrastructure, making it easier to adapt to changing needs.
- **Automation**: IaaS services are known for a high degree of automation, which makes virtual resources easier to manage.
- **Availability**: with an IaaS service, you always have access to your virtual resources, no matter where you are.
- **Enhanced security**: a cloud service can offer higher levels of security and protect your data and applications better than a hosted server.

With IaaS, you can take advantage of these benefits and get the best server for hosting. So if you’re looking for the best hosted server, consider choosing a cloud service instead. You won’t regret it!
