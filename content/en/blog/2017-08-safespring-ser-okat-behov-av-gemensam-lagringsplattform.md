With increasing data volumes across all disciplines, universities and institutions have an ever-growing need to store data efficiently. More and more projects now handle petabyte-scale data, which leads to high costs when setting up in-house storage solutions. Safespring offers an S3-compatible storage solution that can serve as a shared platform for data-intensive projects in the research community.

The platform can be used together with Safespring Compute to process data, or as an archiving platform to which data is sent after being processed locally. S3 is based on HTTPS, enabling researchers to provide raw data and results to stakeholders easily, securely, and cost-effectively. The data is accessible via addresses that can be included as references in publications or in metadata services for publications, behind login portals for additional control.
