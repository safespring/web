{{< ingress >}}
November 30 is the last day to sign contracts under the OCRE IaaS+ 2020 framework agreement.
{{< /ingress >}}

The framework agreement will be replaced by a new one with essentially the same scope. As Safespring understands it, the new framework agreement will enter into force on February 1 at the earliest. If the procurement is appealed, the start date will likely be postponed.

For all organizations covered by the framework agreement, we recommend issuing a call-off this autumn to secure the delivery of cloud services and consultants. A contract signed before the end of November can have a term of up to four years.
