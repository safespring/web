{{< ingress >}}
Today, Safespring becomes one of five providers given the opportunity, via a framework agreement, to deliver cloud services to Sveriges Television (SVT) and Utbildningsradion (UR).
{{< /ingress >}}

The agreement was signed on March 11, and the services SVT requests under the “Cloud services” contract are infrastructure, platform services, distributed storage, machine learning, and database services.

In the procurement, SVT states that it is important to them that the provider offers secure, flexible, and well-documented services. Safespring meets these requirements and produces all services within the Nordics.

{{< quote "Fredric Wallsten, CEO at Safespring" >}}
Open standards, open source, and strong legal safeguards are the foundation of our platform. We are proud to be part of SVT’s framework agreement for cloud services and look forward to the opportunity to advance the digital infrastructure of public service.
