At Safespring, we are proud to be a company that works hard to reduce our environmental impact.

An important step we've taken is ensuring that our data centers run on 100% renewable energy. By choosing renewable energy, we avoid carbon emissions that would otherwise harm the environment.

To validate our sustainability performance, we have chosen to have our services certified by "The Green Web Foundation." This organization works to make the internet a greener place and certifies companies that use renewable energy for their websites and digital services. Having our services certified by The Green Web Foundation is a step in the right direction toward becoming a greener organization.

But it's not just our use of renewable energy that makes us a sustainable business. All our data centers are designed to have a PUE below 1.3. PUE stands for "Power Usage Effectiveness" and is an important metric for measuring a data center's energy efficiency. A PUE below 1.2 means we use a minimal amount of energy to operate our data centers, which is an important part of reducing our environmental impact.

We at Safespring will continue working to reduce our environmental impact and remain a sustainable business. We are proud of our environmental efforts and are determined to do our part to protect our planet.
