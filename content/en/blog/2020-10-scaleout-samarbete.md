AI and machine learning are becoming increasingly important across many types of companies. Data has great value, and those who can make the best use of their data gain a competitive advantage. Scaleout, in collaboration with Safespring, is launching a powerful solution for companies that want to get started with AI easily and position themselves for the future.

### The rapid data-driven shift is a challenge for organizations

Data is rapidly evolving into a strategic resource for both business and the public sector. As data and information increasingly exist in digital form, new business models are emerging, expected to affect most industries and most companies. In such a digital structural transformation, some companies will likely disappear, some will change, and new ones will emerge.

The digital shift entails greater reliance on software and an increasing importance of software companies in society. As software becomes ever more integrated into society, software developers are becoming key builders of today’s society.

The major challenge for organizations is to establish data as a central asset and implement the analytical capabilities necessary to capitalize on the growing and valuable volumes of data.

### Huge opportunities for early movers

Progress in machine learning and AI has accelerated in recent years, with significant advances in algorithms and tools for analyzing data. Machine learning is no longer optional but a central tool for handling the large volumes of data being generated and for coping with intensifying competition.

Organizations that leverage data to develop services, products, and business models—and new applications that exploit large datasets—are emerging. For organizations, this brings benefits such as cost efficiency; automation of processes and workflows; improved revenue generation through deeper customer insights and personalization; better decision support; and the ability to generate predictions about the future—forecasting how markets will develop, when machines will require maintenance, and more.

Scaleout is now launching an open platform for AI and machine learning built on Safespring’s infrastructure to facilitate digital innovation within organizations.

“We want to make it easy for organizations to harness the opportunities of digitalisation. With Safespring as a partner, we can offer a solution that enables accelerated AI adoption while maintaining control of the entire value chain,” says Daniel Zakrisson, co-founder of Scaleout.

The service is available from Safespring, with Scaleout as an expert partner and software provider of AI systems.

“Whoever owns the information holds the power, and it is more important than ever to adhere to the agreed GDPR rules and other laws that safeguard our European values and privacy. That is why the collaboration with Scaleout is particularly important, as it allows companies to maintain control over both the data and the value they can extract from it,” says Fredric Wallsten, CEO of Safespring.

### STACKn is used in production by organizations large and small

For example, STACKn is the foundation of a machine learning portal at SciLifeLab (a leading national infrastructure for life science in Sweden); it is the basis of a Swedish testbed for federated machine learning together with AI Sweden, Hewlett Packard, Zenuity, among others; STACKn is part of a pan-European project in air traffic management involving Eurocontrol, Swiss Airlines, SITA Aero, and other stakeholders; and it is used by small startups such as Smart Recycling (a solution that reduces costs and CO2 emissions in recycling) and Prosilico (a tool that assesses the impact and toxic effects of chemical structures in the human body), to name a few.

This autumn, a series of webinars hosted by Safespring will demonstrate STACKn, where Scaleout deploys a machine learning model in 30 minutes. [Click here to join the webinars](/event/) and read more about STACKn at https://stackn.ai.
