Welcome to Tech AW, where we talk about Hybrid Cloud and future cloud solutions. On August 29 at Solna Business Park.

Book your spot for the summer meetup where ScaleOut Systems talks about fog computing. SUSE will present the concept “Container as a Service Platform” and the Ceph storage platform. Safespring will wrap up by describing how to build Hybrid and Private Cloud in practice and the challenges involved.

You’ll hear from three leading experts in cloud architecture, software, and data systems presenting new solutions and ideas around hybrid cloud, container solutions, and future cloud structures.

The event is organized by Safespring, SUSE, and ScaleOut Systems.
