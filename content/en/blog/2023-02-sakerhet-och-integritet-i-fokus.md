## Security and privacy in focus - Safespring supports Europe’s self-sufficiency in tech

{{< ingress >}}
As technology advances rapidly, we face growing challenges around security and privacy.
{{< /ingress >}}

European companies and organizations are increasingly dependent on tech services from countries outside our own sphere of influence. This means we risk losing control of our data and information flows. To safeguard our digital sovereignty, we must increase our level of self-sufficiency in the tech sector, and this should be prioritized as highly as electricity and metals.

### Partnerships are key

At Safespring, we firmly believe that collaboration between European companies and organizations is the key to achieving a high degree of self-sufficiency in the tech sector. As a Swedish cloud and IT services company focused on security and privacy, we have always understood the importance of controlling our own data and information flows. We look forward to continuing to work with our customers and partners to help increase self-sufficiency and foster a safer, more privacy-focused tech environment.

### Op-ed on Altinget.se

We fully support the op-ed recently published on Altinget.se, where several companies, academics, and influencers urge the government and the Swedish public sector to take Europe’s self-sufficiency in tech seriously. We are convinced that Europe’s self-sufficiency in tech is crucial for protecting the privacy of both organizations and individuals, and for not falling behind in AI development. To achieve this, it is important to deepen collaboration within the European tech sector and strengthen our self-sufficiency. This can help secure our own skills development, benefit business, and increase Europe’s competitiveness in the global market.

### Increasing self-sufficiency in tech

- To safeguard Europe’s digital sovereignty, we must increase our level of self-sufficiency in the tech sector.
- The tech sector should be prioritized as highly as electricity and metals.
- Greater collaboration among European companies and organizations is key to achieving a high degree of independence.
