The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) supports the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF), but there are concerns regarding data protection.

The DPF has been improved with requirements of necessity and proportionality for U.S. intelligence collection, but onward data transfers and the protection of EU citizens’ rights require clarification.

The EDPB urges the European Commission to ensure that safeguards for data transfers to third countries are effective and to monitor the implementation of the principles of necessity and proportionality. Companies should be cautious with data transfers to third countries and review their data protection strategies to reduce the risk of legal challenges.

I believe the EDPB will approve this proposal, which means data transfers to the U.S. will become legal.

However, Max Schrems will very likely file a new lawsuit, dubbed "Schrems III," as soon as the approval is in place. After that, we can expect a period of about 1–2 years before the Court of Justice of the EU takes up the case again and possibly strikes down the decision.

The reason is that the new arrangement rests mainly on an executive order and transparency remains limited. These are my personal reflections, but I’ve also discussed them with several others, which makes me confident this development is quite likely.

It is important to note that if the DPF cannot guarantee the protection of EU citizens’ rights, it could lead to a "Schrems III" scenario. This would mean that companies relying on the DPF for EU–U.S. data transfers would suddenly face legal uncertainty and potential sanctions.

One solution already available is to choose European IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) providers to store and process data within the EU. This reduces the risk of transfers to third countries and helps protect personal data. Companies can also use technical measures such as encryption and pseudonymization to further safeguard personal data. By being proactive and focusing on protecting EU citizens’ rights, companies can reduce the risk of disruption caused by future legal challenges and help build a more robust and sustainable data protection environment.
