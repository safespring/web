<div class="ingress"><p>The number of companies planning to outsource their IT operations has decreased, due in part to the need to work more in agile/DevOps teams.</p></div>

A full 70 percent cite local DevOps as the reason they choose to reduce the share of outsourced projects according to [Whiteline Research and PA Consulting](https://computersweden.idg.se/2.2683/1.718033/digitaliseringsvagen-bromsar-outsourcing).

Safespring is committed to open standards, and our platform is based on open source. This trend toward reduced outsourcing has many advantages. To take advantage of new technologies and evolve toward a modern infrastructure, we offer two DevOps packages that will take you a long way.

Not everyone has the resources required to manage a local DevOps team, and in that case one of Safespring’s support packages may be what’s needed to bring a project across the finish line.
