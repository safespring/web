According to Adam Odmark, the European Data Protection Board should issue guidance regarding American cloud services.

> There is hardly any European company or public authority that does not use cloud services. The trend is also moving toward increasingly cloud-based IT solutions. - Adam Odmark

He believes that the risk of a conflict between the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the CLOUD Act is something these companies and authorities already have to contend with today.

One solution is to move sensitive data out of the American clouds and store it within the country’s borders with a local provider that is subject to the same legislation as the company or authority.

Many companies and institutions have already taken this step, including by choosing our Swedish cloud service. Read more about our customers and their experience with Safespring here:

Adam Odmark believes that the situation between the GDPR and the U.S. CLOUD Act requires urgent action.

> The European Data Protection Board should act urgently and tell European companies and public authorities what they should do to be able to sell and use cloud services without having to worry about violating the GDPR. - Adam Odmark
