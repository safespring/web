By web-based office suite we mean fully integrated, web-based email, word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, chat, file storage, and document management.

Today, the _"[Pre-study Report: Web-based Office Suites](https://www.avropa.se/globalassets/forstudierapporter-vt--it/forstudierapport-webbaserat-kontorsstod2.pdf?_t_id=1B2M2Y8AsgTpgAmY7PhCfg%3d%3d&_t_q=%22forstudierapport-webbaserat-kontorsstod%22&_t_tags=language%3asv%2csiteid%3a95d515a5-23ca-47bf-87a9-07b10d8ac360&_t_ip=109.238.132.56&_t_hit.id=Avropa_Core_Models_Media_GenericMedia/_ba5d22e5-3a3a-4719-a772-ee0e89e9f617&_t_hit.pos=1) "_ was released. The National Procurement Services launched a pre-study last September that may result in a future procurement of web-based office support.

It is positive that this debate is gaining momentum. The political situation has left many with one foot in foreign cloud services that no longer comply with applicable rules and laws. Among other things, the CLOUD Act in the United States means that files and data stored in American cloud services should be regarded as disclosed under eSam.

Safespringâ€™s white paper on the CLOUD Act has been used in the report as a reference to the political situation between the EU and the US. [Feel free to download the document here.](/whitepaper/cloudact/)

## Recommendations

There must be interest and a willingness to invest among public-sector actors for a market for web-based office suites to emerge.

The report concludes that there is a need for a legally sustainable web-based office suite that supports file storage, document management, collaboration tools, word processing, email, and other functions.

At the same time, it emerged that the existing framework agreements are not sufficient to procure similar services. There must be interest and a willingness to invest among public-sector actors for a market for web-based office suites to emerge. Therefore, the National Procurement Services encourages dialogue between IT companies and public-sector actors to jointly arrive at a solution that can be procured in the future.

Safespring will follow developments closely and will contribute to the dialogue with our expertise in secure, modern, and local cloud services. At the time of writing, we are on site for the presentation of the pre-study. The photo shows Daniel Melin, an IT procurement officer at Kammarkollegiet.
