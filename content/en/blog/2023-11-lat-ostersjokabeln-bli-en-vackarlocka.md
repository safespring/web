At Safespring, our commitment has always been not only to innovate in cloud technology, but also to ensure that these innovations contribute to a resilient and secure digital environment for Sweden and Europe.

The article ["Let the Baltic Sea cable be a wake-up call – digital infrastructure needs a preparedness boost"](https://www.nyteknik.se/debatt/lat-ostersjokabeln-bli-en-vackarklocka-digital-infrastruktur-behover-ett-beredskapslyft/4208118) serves as an important reminder of the challenges we face in digital infrastructure. These challenges are not only about maintaining services, but about protecting the very backbone of our modern society. As part of the Swedish tech community, we understand the significance of these vulnerabilities and the potential impact they can have on our society, our economy, and national security.

Our work at Safespring, in line with the issues raised in the article, is about more than just delivering cloud services. It’s about contributing to a robust digital infrastructure that can withstand challenges from hybrid warfare and other emerging threats.
