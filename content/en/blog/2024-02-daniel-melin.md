“I’ve had many conversations with SaaS companies that have locked themselves into American cloud services. They have a great service but have struggled to find customers in the public sector because of their dependence on American cloud services. My time in the public sector has equipped me with a deep understanding of the potential of cloud services,” Daniel reflects.

His commitment to open source since 1996 underscores our shared vision of openness and collaboration as the foundation for progress.

Daniel sees an exciting future at Safespring: “Sharing knowledge and driving innovation is at the heart of what I want to achieve here.” His ambitions and our pursuit of flexible, secure open-source cloud services, digital sovereignty, and open standards go hand in hand.

In his role as the person responsible for Safespring’s commercial strategy across research, academia, and the public sector, Daniel Melin will play a pivotal role in strengthening the company’s partnerships and contributing to key projects and initiatives. One of his main focuses will be deepening relationships with research institutions and government agencies, which is essential for Safespring’s continued success and expansion.

A concrete example of Daniel’s area of work is Safespring’s participation in the EOSC (European Open Science Cloud) and OCRE (Open Clouds for Research Environments) projects. Through these initiatives, Safespring aims to provide cloud-based solutions that facilitate research and education across Europe. Daniel’s expertise and experience will be central to navigating these complex projects and ensuring that Safespring can offer services that truly meet the needs of the research community.
