## Hope you’ve had an eventful year too

I hope you’ve had a year as eventful and exciting as we have at Safespring.

Our services are primarily based on open source, and we believe in being part of an ecosystem where more people contribute to improving applications without being hindered by license fees or proprietary solutions that lock users in.

We’ve seen the use of open source accelerate during 2018, and we believe it will continue to play a major role in the digitalization of society—for example, benefiting the digital transformation currently underway in the Swedish education sector. During the year, Safespring became a member of Swedish EdTech to contribute our expertise in large-scale services where security is the focus, and where open source and open standards ensure no one gets locked into our platform.

### Where data is stored has never been more important

This spring, the EU and the US showed how different their philosophies on data privacy can be. The CLOUD Act was passed in the US, making it impossible for many organizations to remain in US-based clouds. The fact that US providers establish operations in Sweden and Norway does not change this. The CLOUD Act still gives US authorities the right to obtain data from US providers regardless of where they are geographically established.

By contrast, with GDPR the EU demonstrated the high level of personal data protection that applies in Europe. No one can have missed what a substantial effort this has required. Where data is stored has never been as important as it is now. Safespring was designed from the start with GDPR in mind, and with us your data never leaves the country.

### Greater flexibility is a trend

Multi-cloud has been a buzzword in 2018. How to avoid vendor lock-in using container technology. That’s just one example of topics Safespring has addressed at our events and in opinion pieces during the year. In 2019 we will continue to host events and write opinion pieces. Make sure you receive all updates and invitations at the right email address. You can easily register a new address via our newsletter page.

Safespring grew by just over 200 percent in 2018, and we want to thank all of you for the progress we’ve made together. We look forward to continuing to grow with you next year.

In many parts of the world there are other, much more fundamental problems that must be solved, which is why this year we chose to make a donation to Save the Children to help them create safety for families in affected areas.

### Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

Warm wishes from Fredric, and everyone at Safespring.
