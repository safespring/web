{{< ingress >}}
Together with Sunet, we have developed a file management and collaboration service for universities, university colleges, and affiliated public agencies on Sunet’s network.

The [Sunet Drive](/dokument/sunet/sunet-drive/) service helps users comply with GDPR, is delivered on Safespring Private Cloud from Swedish data centers where Sunet operates the solution, and retains #digitalsovereignty.
