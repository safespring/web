## Safespring shifts into the next gear!

<div class="ingress"><p>Safespring hires Johan Harrysson as Chief Commercial Officer.</p></div>

Safespring, which delivers secure, fast, and flexible cloud and IT infrastructure services, grew rapidly in 2019.
During the year, the Safespring IaaS platform grew by over 90 percent, and the number of customers on
Safespring’s service platform passed the 100 mark. Growth is driven by the increasing need among companies
and organizations in Sweden for efficient cloud services produced in Sweden and governed by Swedish, rather
than American, legislation.

Safespring has recruited Johan Harrysson to lead the company’s commercial development in the role of
Chief Commercial Officer, responsible for the commercial offering, sales, and marketing. Johan has extensive
experience developing software companies specializing in cloud services and most recently served as CEO of
Palette Software AB and, before that, of Infobric AB.

says Johan Harrysson.

> “Safespring offers a highly automated service that is perfect for customers seeking a secure, efficient, and flexible
> cloud and IT infrastructure service. After the success of the past two years, we need to shift up another
> gear to meet demand from our customers and reseller partners. I’m confident that Johan’s
> experience will help us achieve our ambitious goals”

says Mikael Schütt, Chairman of the Board at Safespring.
