{{< ingress >}}
In infrastructure code (and other code, too) it is a good practice
to separate the program logic from its input data (configuration). That way,
in order to change the state of our infrastructure, we only need to change the
input data and not the program unless the logic of the program changes.
{{< /ingress >}}


In the [previous blog post][pulblog1], we went through a basic setup of Pulumi with
the Python template for using it to manage OpenStack resources in Safespring.
This is a good starting point to understand the basics of how one can use Python
together with Pulumi to declaratively manage infrastructure resources without
having to write all resource graph management from the ground and up, which, of
course, also would be possible with Python or any modern programming language
for that matter.

One problem with the first example is that the configuration (instance name,
flavor, network, and so on) is embedded inside the Python code.

While that approach serves as a nice self-contained example it quickly becomes
both error-prone and tedious having to change the Python program every time a
new object (an instance for instance ;-)) should be added, changed,
reconfigured or removed.

If the configuration was stored outside the program and loaded into it upon
execution, for example, in the most ubiquitous ["human-friendly data
serialization language"][yaml] in IT today: [YAML][yaml], then that would be
an improvement over the initial approach, right?

## Prerequisites

* [Python/Pulumi blog post number 1][pulblog1]

## Reading the instance configuration from a YAML file


Consider the following Python code:
```Python
"""An OpenStack Python Pulumi program"""

import pulumi
from pulumi_openstack import compute
from pulumi_openstack import networking
from ruamel.yaml import YAML
import os.path

# Configure the behavior for the yaml module
yaml=YAML(typ='safe')
yaml.default_flow_style = False

# Load config data from YAML file representation
# into Python dictionary representation

config_data_file = "pulumi-config.yaml"
if os.path.isfile(config_data_file):
  fh = open(config_data_file, "r")
  config_dict = yaml.load(fh)
else:
  print(f'The file {config_data_file} does not exist!')
  exit(1)


instances = {}
for i in config_dict:
  instances[i['name']] = compute.Instance(i['name'],
        name = i['name'],
        flavor_name = i['flavor'],
        networks = [{"name": i['network']}],
        image_name = i["image"])
```

In this example, we have taken the same minimal set of parameters needed to
define an instance as in [example 1][pulblog1], but instead of specifying the
parameters in the code, we read them from a dictionary, which again comes from
de-serializing data from the `pulumi-config.yaml` file. In addition, we create
a loop that iterates over a list of instances, with parameters in each list
item from the yaml-file.

And the `pulumi-config.yaml` file looks like this:

```yaml
---
- name: pulumi-snipp
  flavor: l2.c2r4.100
  image: ubuntu-22.04
  network: default
- name: pulumi-snapp
  flavor: l2.c2r4.500
  image: ubuntu-22.04
  network: public
```

So now we can just run `pulumi up` and iterate over the list of instances in
the YAML file to converge desired into state to actual state? Well, first, we
actually need to update the `virtualenv` the Pulumi program uses in order to
make use of the `ruamel.yaml` module. To ensure the change persists
when replicating the setup in other places (a pipeline for instance) we should
add the `ruamel.yaml` module to the `requirements.txt` file and then run
`venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt` in order to update the installed
Python libraries according to the requirements.

Now, we can apply the desired state by:

```shell
(oscli) ubuntu@demo-jumphost:~/pulumi$ pulumi up

(oscli) ubuntu@demo-jumphost:~/pulumi$
```

Let's inspect what was created by using OpenStack CLI:
```shell
(oscli) ubuntu@demo-jumphost:~/pulumi$ openstack server list |grep pulu
| 48d1cb9f-d732-4684-82e8-aa89ca05c5b9 | pulumi-snapp                          | ACTIVE  | public=212.162.147.53, 2a09:d400:0:1::2b1  | ubuntu-22.04             | l2.c2r4.500  |
| 5870d687-5aac-40b8-8f23-e54755e0fc62 | pulumi-snipp                          | ACTIVE  | default=10.68.3.95, 2a09:d400:0:2::82      | ubuntu-22.04             | l2.c2r4.100  |
(oscli) ubuntu@demo-jumphost:~/pulumi$
```

Looks like Pulumi kept it's promise.


## Adding security groups for access

It is not much fun to provision (and pay for) instances that can't be reached,
so let's extend the setup to add some security groups and rules so the
services on the instances will be reachable.

Thus, we'll make changes to the Pulumi program so that it will accept
the configuration of security groups and rules from the configuration YAML file and
add the list of security group memberships as parameters to the instances.

The new Python code also reflects a different structure in the YAML
configuration file; we moved the list of instances below a new sub-tree called
`instances`, and, unsurprisingly, placed the security groups under the
`security_groups` sub-tree with rules for each security group as "leaf nodes" under
each security group.

Like this:
```yaml
---
security_groups:
  ssh-from-the-world:
    ssh:
      direction: ingress
      ethertype: IPv4
      protocol: tcp
      port_range_min: 22
      port_range_max: 22
      remote_ip_prefix: 0.0.0.0/0
  web:
    https:
      direction: ingress
      ethertype: IPv4
      protocol: tcp
      port_range_min: 443
      port_range_max: 443
      remote_ip_prefix: 0.0.0.0/0
    http:
      direction: ingress
      ethertype: IPv4
      protocol: tcp
      port_range_min: 80
      port_range_max: 80
      remote_ip_prefix: 0.0.0.0/0

instances:
  - name: pulumi-snipp
    flavor: l2.c2r4.100
    image: ubuntu-22.04
    network: default
    security_groups:
      - ssh-from-the-world
  - name: pulumi-snapp
    flavor: l2.c2r4.500
    image: ubuntu-22.04
    network: public
    security_groups:
      - ssh-from-the-world
```

And then the updated Pulumi program that will implement the logic structure of
the YAML-file:

```python
"""An OpenStack Python Pulumi program"""

import pulumi
from pulumi_openstack import compute
from pulumi_openstack import networking
from ruamel.yaml import YAML
import os.path

# Configure the behavior for the yaml module
yaml=YAML(typ='safe')
yaml.default_flow_style = False

# Load config data from YAML file representation
# into Python dictionary representation

config_data_file = "pulumi-config.yaml"
if os.path.isfile(config_data_file):
  fh = open(config_data_file, "r")
  config_dict = yaml.load(fh)
else:
  print(f'The file {config_data_file} does not exist!')
  exit(1)


security_groups = {}
for sg in config_dict['security_groups']:
  security_groups[sg] = networking.SecGroup(sg,
        name = sg)
  for sgr in config_dict['security_groups'][sg]:
    rule = {}
    rule = config_dict['security_groups'][sg][sgr]
    security_groups[sgr] =  networking.SecGroupRule(sgr,
      direction = rule['direction'],
      ethertype = rule['ethertype'],
      protocol = rule['protocol'],
      port_range_min = rule['port_range_min'],
      port_range_max = rule['port_range_max'],
      security_group_id = security_groups[sg].id)



instances = {}
for i in config_dict['instances']:
  instances[i['name']] = compute.Instance(i['name'],
    name = i['name'],
	flavor_name = i['flavor'],
	networks = [{"name": i['network']}],
    security_groups = i['security_groups'],
	image_name = i["image"])
```

Let's run the Pulumi program and see how the desired state of our IaaS changes
according to the YAML configuration file structure:

```shell

While applying the state, we see that one of the planned actions failed due to an API
timeout on the OpenStack API. This sometimes happens, and when it does, it is nice
to have a tool that keeps track of the current state and what was done even if some
actions failed. In this sense, Pulumi behaves the same as Terraform and will
pick up the remaining changes on the next state application. So, let's run the
Pulumi program again and see what happens:

```shell
(oscli) ubuntu@demo-jumphost:~/pulumi$ pulumi up

(oscli) ubuntu@demo-jumphost:~/pulumi$
```

And just as expected, there was only one update remaining, and it was quickly
converged to the desired state described in the YAML configuration file. Now,
the desired state should be equal to the actual state.

Let's check to verify.

```shell

It seems like Pulumi kept its promises again. Note that we can immediately reach
the RFC1918 address of the instance on the `default` network. If you wonder why
this "just works", please read the blog post about [the Safespring network
model][netblog].

## Conclusion

Starting from where we left our first and very basic [Pulumi example][pulblog1],
we have continued to show the value of combining the `ruamel.yaml`. Python
library in combination with a Python-driven Pulumi program to quickly
generalize Python code by separating the concerns of code and configuration
data.
