In the current global political landscape it is obvious that Europe’s dependency on USA and China when it comes to IT products and services is disastrous for Europe’s future. Europe therefore needs to act swiftly to regain control over it’s own destiny.

There have been many attempts to strengthening European IT industry. Research grants, political statements, laws, regulations, policies, Gaia-X etc. But in hindsight, neither of them succeeded since Europe is more dependent on China and USA than ever before.

It’s time to realize that everything in Europe is dependent on IT and that Europe must be able to stand on it’s own when it comes to critical infrastructure.

If neither research grants, political statements, laws, regulations, policies nor Gaia-X etc. worked well, what could work? The latest idea is EuroStack. An industry led initiative that pushes the European Commission to adopt regulations that forces the public sector in EU to buy more European IT goods and services.

But, isn’t that protectionism? In some way it is but it will still be much less protectionism that what China and USA already has in place. If USA and China isn’t open for free trade, why should Europe be open? We are just being treated as a colony.

Is EuroStack an organization? Can anyone join? No it’s not an organization and that’s on purpose. Look how USA and China destroyed Gaia-X from within. Secondly, this is just industry players that want to provide the best goods and services to European customers. No organization is needed for that.

But, isn’t European IT solutions inferior to Chinese and American? Sometimes yes, sometimes no, but the only way forward is to strengthening European IT industry so that we catch up where there are deficiencies.

Join Safespring and about 100 other companies in the push for a healthy and competitive European IT industry!
