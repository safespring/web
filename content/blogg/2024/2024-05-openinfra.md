Hello everyone,

I'm Jon Ander Novella de Miguel, and I had the pleasure of representing Safespring at the OpenInfra Days held in Gothenburg on May 7, 2024. Although we missed seeing many of you there, I’m excited to share the essence of our session and how Safespring is pushing the boundaries of open source infrastructure.

### Our Presentation: Enhancing Infrastructure with NATS and Huma

Our talk, "Using NATS and Huma to Enhance Open Source Infrastructure," focused on how these technologies are integral to fostering a robust, secure, and flexible digital environment, especially for B2B and European research communities. We're committed to providing solutions that not only meet current demands but also anticipate future challenges.

### Highlights from the event:

1. **Our mission and vision:**
   As part of Safespring's commitment, I discussed our ongoing efforts to serve as the foundation for digital development through reliable and scalable cloud services. Our vision is to remain leaders in innovative and secure cloud solutions, with a strong emphasis on data sovereignty and open standards.
2. **Self-service API innovations:**
   I shared our advancements in self-service API capabilities, designed to empower users with controlled provisioning and distributed management. This is particularly aligned with the European Open Science Cloud initiative, supporting a federated infrastructure that spans across numerous research facilities and enterprises.
3. **Technical deep dive into Huma and NATS:**
   The technical core of our presentation was centered on the use of Huma for backing HTTP APIs with a structured approach and NATS for its superior messaging capabilities that enhance communication across services. These tools are pivotal in managing complex, distributed systems efficiently.
4. **Addressing integration challenges:**
   Integrating diverse platforms poses substantial challenges. I outlined our strategic approaches to ensure seamless interoperability between different cloud services such as OpenStack and OKD, focusing on synchronization, error handling, and efficient resource management.
