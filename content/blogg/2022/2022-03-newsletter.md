## We have updated the names of our compute flavors
The core of Safespring's platform is our virtual machines that come in several different flavors. Instances created from a flavor include CPU, RAM, and possibly a local disk. Now it's easier than ever to know what such an instance contains just by its new flavor name.

All our flavors follow this new name set, making it easier for everyone who uses our platform. In our price calculator, you can see the new names today.
