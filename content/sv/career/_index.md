At Safespring we're not just building systems; we're building relationships. We understand that applying for a new role is a big step, and we aim to make it a smooth, transparent, and engaging experience for you.

1. **Intro chat** - this is a great opportunity for both of us to get to know each other and decide if we have a match.
2. **Meet your future manager** - deep dive into your engineering experiences.
3. **Tech interviews** focused on system design and programming skills with your future team.
4. **Sync with your recruiter** - all your interviewers will make a collaborative decision and will either present you with an employment offer and **celebrate**, or provide you with constructive feedback and encourage to stay connected!

#### Flexibility in Every Step

We recognize that talent comes in many forms and that the standard interview process isn’t one-size-fits-all. If you have ideas on how you would prefer to showcase your skills, we’re all ears! Our goal is to give you an opportunity to show us how you work best.
