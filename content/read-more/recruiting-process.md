We understand that applying for a new role is a big step, and we aim to make it a smooth, transparent, and engaging experience for you.

1.	**Intro chat** - this is a great opportunity for both of us to get to know each other and decide if we have a match
2.	**Meet your future manager** - deep dive into your engineering experiences 
3.	**Tech interviews**
	1. **System Design** - let’s talk architecture and how you approach system scalability, reliability, and security.
	2. **Programming Deep Dive** - here’s your chance to impress us with your coding skills by walking us through one of your projects. 
4.  **Sync with your recruiter** - all your interviewers will make a collaborative decision and will either present you with an employment offer and celebrate, or provide you with constructive feedback and encourage to stay connected! 

Flexibility in Every Step: We recognize that talent comes in many forms and that the standard interview process isn’t one-size-fits-all. If you have ideas on how you would prefer to showcase your skills, we’re all ears! Our goal is to give you an opportunity to show us how you work best.
